Mandatory,good,average,good,0,32168039,0,,awesome,5,WRI203,Claudio is by far my favourite professor. He gives constructive advice every time you bring a piece of writing to him during appointments. He's very sweet and answers every question with precision. He teaches so everyone can understand what he's talking about and gives plenty of examples. He's an amazing guy and has a good sense of humour.,08/13/2019,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1565659561000,Yes,4928,Yes,,N/A,"['Gives good feedback', 'Caring', 'Accessible outside class']",people,people
