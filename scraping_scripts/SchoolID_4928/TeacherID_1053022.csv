N/A,average,good,average,0,20668860,0,,average,2,RLG202,For an intro course she treats the class like they were already taught Judaism. I took the course to learn about Judaism as I was not raised Jewish and did not learn it through school. She should teach the class like they don't already have a strong knowledge base on the religion. This is an INTRO course!
