N/A,good,average,good,0,21138316,0,,awesome,4,ERS120,"Excellent and nice prof! Unlike the other earth science prof, Terry is very hands-on which is why he has practicals instead of tutorials. Unfortunately, UTM has decided to replace him because he is not as ""academic"" as the other profs. Considering it is EARTH SCIENCE, one would figure a hands-on approach would be more valuable than an academic one.",12/20/2012,2.0,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,1356017483000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,20414643,0,,awesome,5,ERS120,I had Terry for a few Earth Sciences classes a while back and he is an amazing prof.  He helps his students out so much whether it's understanding the material presented or looking to connect with professionals with industry.

He prefers to be called by his first name Terry and if you talk to him often he will help you out. He takes all questions from the textbook (you must get it) and puts them on the test.
