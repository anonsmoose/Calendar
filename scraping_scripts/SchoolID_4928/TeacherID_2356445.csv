Mandatory,good,good,good,0,32251270,0,,awesome,5,JCP421,"Hi, I had Richard Kil for thermodynamics and Quantum Mechanics 2. In both classes, he went above and beyond to try to teach the material in the clearest way possible. Additionally, he made it difficult enough to not slack off, and really focus on learning the material. He is BY FAR the best prof I've had, and he inspired me to do research in QM.",09/28/2019,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1569644562000,Yes,4928,Yes,,A+,"['Accessible outside class', 'Lots of homework', 'Gives good feedback']",people,people

The main issue was that he wasn't very good at judging the difficulty level of the tests he gave us, and most students were unhappy about that. He's pretty okay as a lecturer, but needs more experience with writing fair tests.",04/09/2018,4.0,4.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1523265913000,No,4928,Yes,,N/A,"['Test heavy', 'Caring', 'Accessible outside class']",people,people

He doesn't know how to prepare his students for the tests and only shows derivations in class (which never shows up anyways). He literally re-writes his exact same notes in class (the same ones he posts online) and never does any problems. The labs are very helpful since they bump up the mark.",04/05/2018,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1522934201000,No,4928,Yes,,N/A,"['Test heavy', 'Tough grader']",people,people
