Listening to his lecture is like music to my ears, because he's always so informative. I've always wanted to be able to speak like him, and be thorough like he is when he's on TV. He's so nice to his students too. This prof rocks. ",07/28/2015,3.0,3.0,,5,Really into it,5.0,5.0,1,No,1438109907000,N/A,4928,Yes,,B+,"['Hilarious', 'Caring', 'Gives good feedback']",people,people
