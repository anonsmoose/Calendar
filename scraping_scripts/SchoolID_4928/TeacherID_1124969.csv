Just don't be late for class, and participate a bit in class and she'll love you.",06/13/2017,2.0,2.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,No,1497393834000,Yes,4928,Yes,,A-,"[""Skip class?

At the same time a extremely talented lecturer, and quite attractive too. assignment/tests are hard, but She gave detailed feedback on essays, very encouraging.
