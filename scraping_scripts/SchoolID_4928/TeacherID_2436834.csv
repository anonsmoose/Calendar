The test, exam, and assignments were extremely fair. The course itself is also very interesting. There is no textbook but he makes his own notes which is like a packet of 20 each class (kind of his own textbook).",12/19/2018,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1545214510000,Yes,4928,Yes,,A+,"['Respected', 'Caring', 'Accessible outside class']",people,people

His lectures are a bit heavy, but he hands out very detailed notes that work as a substitute to the textbook in most cases. He can also be very funny, caring, and helpful when you need his help.",12/06/2018,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1544086988000,Yes,4928,Yes,,N/A,"['Lecture heavy', 'Get ready to read', 'Group projects']",people,people
