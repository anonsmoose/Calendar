He would always put up a lecture outline each lecture, and go over a ton of examples as he taught. He would also stop frequently to ask if every1 was keeping up. The tests and exam were based off of lectures &amp; practice problems and he was always willing to go the extra mile to help you out. 110% recommended",09/23/2019,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1569200947000,Yes,4928,Yes,,A,"['Gives good feedback', 'Accessible outside class', 'Inspirational']",people,people

There hasn't been a lecture without him making a string of mistakes in his lectures, erasing nearly EVERYTHING and then re-writing things in parts, confusing the whole class. Horrid, bland lectures.
