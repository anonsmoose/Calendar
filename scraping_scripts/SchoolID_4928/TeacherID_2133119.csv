Mandatory,good,average,good,0,27016613,0,,awesome,5,GGR276,Fantastic professor that works really hard to engage students. You will need the textbook because some of the things she tests on are not in the lectures. Her assignments are laid out very clearly and she is very approachable when you have questions. This course might be a little tough if you are new to statistics terminology.,10/05/2016,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1475708083000,Yes,4928,Yes,,N/A,"['Amazing lectures', 'Accessible outside class', 'Hilarious']",people,people
