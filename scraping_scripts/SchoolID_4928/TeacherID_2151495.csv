Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,26959962,0,,good,4,ECO200,Barber is  a good easy prof but his lectures can be quite boring (very boring). All he does is basically READ HIS SLIDES WORD FROM WORD in class and draw a few diagrams on the board once in a while.  not a lot of people show up to his lectures (like 20/200 people). Just go to tutorials (many questions in tutorial show up on the test like 75-100%),09/07/2016,1.0,1.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,No,1473265180000,Yes,4928,Yes,,A,"['Accessible outside class', 'Graded by few things', 'Caring']",people,people
