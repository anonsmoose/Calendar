N/A,good,good,good,0,23721320,0,,awesome,5,RLG202H5,Very good prof. Takes the time to know your name very early in the semester. Was helpful at all times and gives useful tips about the exam. I got an A- and the reason I didn't get an A is because the TA wanted to punish me for being messianic jewish. She doesn't care what you deserve she just wants to bring down the class average.
