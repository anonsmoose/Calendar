He is himself a really nice and approachable guy, who is always willing to help and clarify the complicated concepts.

Midterms were fair wrt questions but he graded a little too difficult. Also be sure to check over your midterms when he hands them back, he made a few errors when marking both. Final exam was brutal - pretty sure he scaled grades up at the end of the course. Recommended!",09/10/2009,3.0,3.0,,5,Really into it,4.0,4.0,1,No,1252589478000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
