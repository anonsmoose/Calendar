Her powerpoints were minimal, with only quotes from the readings on them. She offered no way of reviewing what she taught later, so taking notes is a must. The papers are pretty simple. There's a lot of class time, about 6 hours/week.",01/02/2016,3.0,3.0,,3,Low,3.0,3.0,1,No,1451705155000,N/A,4928,Yes,,B+,"['Lecture heavy', 'Get ready to read', 'Participation matters']",people,people
