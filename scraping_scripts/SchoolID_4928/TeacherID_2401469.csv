Tests are very fair and should be pretty straight forward as long as you studied for them. There are several textbooks but they are optional and are not tested. Our class also went on field trips, which were nice breaks from just academics!",01/10/2019,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1547138217000,Yes,4928,Yes,,A+,"['Inspirational', 'Accessible outside class', 'Gives good feedback']",people,people
