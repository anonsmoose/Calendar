N/A,average,average,average,2,26173968,0,,average,2,WRI340H5,Dittrich is a good professor. He can make lectures really interesting and seems very down-to-earth. He does assign weekly scholarly readings and I find he marks harder than the other writing profs. The course was a mix of interesting (music) and a mix of non-interesting (economic and political discussion).,03/23/2016,3.0,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,1458721396000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,"['So many papers', 'Hilarious', 'Caring']",people,people
