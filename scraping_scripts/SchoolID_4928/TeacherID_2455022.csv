Her lectures were quite interesting and fun to sit through. 3 hours felt like 1 hour and she brought the course material to life.

She is very easy to approach and accommodating. There are a lot of group projects and assignments, which can be good for some people but also a drawback for others.",01/10/2019,3.0,3.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1547154633000,No,4928,Yes,,A-,"['Caring', 'Tough grader', 'Lecture heavy']",people,people
