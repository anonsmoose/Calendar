Her transition between concepts was vague and lectures are not very interactive, but she's approachable for content-related clarification so ask! The lecture material is simple but picky grading. The textbook is ambiguous (since the field is new), but focus reading on lecture-concepts and you'd be on-track.",12/14/2019,3.0,3.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1576292819000,No,4928,Yes,,A-,"['Get ready to read', 'Tough grader']",people,people

She is so monotone that you cant stay awake in class, I wasnt the only one with this problem. Overall, she is very socially awkward so I dont think this helps with being a professor.
