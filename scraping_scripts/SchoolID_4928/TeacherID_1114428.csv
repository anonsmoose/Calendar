N/A,average,average,average,0,19562295,0,,average,3,HIS101,"I took this class in 2009. It wasn't that bad... boring busy work. Evaluation was based on participation in a mandatory grammar tutorial, 500-word response essays, and a longer final essay. The format has since changed. No knowledge of history necessary - just had to know how to write. I had a good TA and ended up with an 88.

N/A,average,average,average,0,18420480,0,,average,3,HIS101,When I took his class I found it really boring. The only reason I did well is because I am good at history. But lectures were boring and if 270 people were registered in the class only 50-100 students would come. TA's were online. They would grade our papers and give us feedbacks. Writing is workshop useless and boring.,04/16/2011,2.0,2.0,,3,Meh,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1302966986000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
