Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,28902841,0,,good,4,JOUA01H3,He's a good and nice professor who teaches efficiently. He's kind and helps in any way he can. However he assigns essays less than a week before it's due. So you'll have to cram your time to get the work in on time. He's not a tough grader so you'll be okay.

Not Mandatory,good,average,good,1,23636643,0,,awesome,4,SMC315H1F,Professor Valpy is a boon to the Book and Media Studies program. He is the type of lecturer that aims to instill insights and experiences to his students:  he gives a theoretical crash course to newspaper theory while supplementing it with lectures given by prominent guest speakers (i.e. Robyn Doolittle).
