He covers a lot of material without shying away from the real philosophical issues.  That makes it difficult to follow, but it is a small price to pay for the profundity of what you get in return.

Passage identifications were obvious, all you had to do match them to a philosopher's position (again, go to lecture).  Gave you the pool of essay questions for the tests in advance, which was helpful. Only downside was he was unorganised.

Problem is his unrealistic expectations. 2 tests (midterm and final), with really hard essay questions and having to identify passages (which he made harder bc students did bad the first time..). Had no office hrs. Very obscure & difficult material. Would not recommend ",03/30/2015,5.0,5.0,,2,Low,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1427717286000,N/A,1484,Yes,,N/A,[],people,people
