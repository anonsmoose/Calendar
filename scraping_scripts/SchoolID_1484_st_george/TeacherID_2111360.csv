N/A,good,average,good,0,31227108,0,,good,4,SWK4606,Good prof. Engaging and Personable. Creates a good class atmosphere. However the structure and design of this specific course is not that great. Wish she had added more specific links to everyday practice and that the topics of each week wore more focused and not so abstract. Fair marker and she does not overwhelm you with readings and assignments,01/09/2019,2.0,2.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,No,1546995569000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Caring', 'Respected']",people,people
