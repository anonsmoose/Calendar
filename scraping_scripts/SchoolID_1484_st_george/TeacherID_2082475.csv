He spends time discussing debated concepts in his field and how people experimented to come to certain conclusions, which greatly inspired me.

You leave the class knowing much more than what was strictly taught in class, because you can extend the concepts learned to other areas of biology. You need to be ready to work hard to do well in the class.
