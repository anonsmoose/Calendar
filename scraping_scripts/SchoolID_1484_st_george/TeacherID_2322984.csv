Mandatory,good,average,good,2,31570287,0,,awesome,5,SLA248,"Great course to take. Although there are many readings, most of them are quite short. There are a couple essays (very short) you have to write, a small presentation and 20% is participation. Overall a great elective with interesting topics (19-20th century literature + some modern short stories). Small lecture size is also great.",04/11/2019,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1554942044000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A,"['Amazing lectures', 'Gives good feedback', 'Participation matters']",people,people
N/A,good,average,good,2,31459003,0,,awesome,5,SLA358,Amazing professor! It was very interesting to take his courses since I don't have literature background. Eye opening experience. A lot of readings but if you put in some effort you're guaranteed an A or a B+. Prof helps you to analyze literature in a way you couldn't imagine before. It develops your communication/writing skills as well.

He makes the class very interesting, there is a lot of reading that you have to do (approximately a book a read) but if you enjoy Slavic and Ukrainian studies this is a class worth taking. His classes are almost entirely discussion based.",12/16/2017,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1513430922000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Lots of homework', 'Hilarious', 'Get ready to read']",people,people
