Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,32620261,0,,good,4,SLA256,Awesome prof. Have taken 3 courses with him and SLA256 was clear and easy. Koznarsky gives great feedback on essays and genuinely seems to enjoy getting to read them and see everyones different takes on things. Always willing to give an extension or talk after class for clarity. Only downside is that he is very monotone and can put you to sleep.,12/12/2019,1.0,1.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,No,1576115972000,Yes,1484,Yes,,B+,"['Get ready to read', 'So many papers', 'Test heavy']",people,people

Readings are well-chosen--some works I hadn't heard of before have now become my favourites. Lectures are very detailed, but easy to follow and enjoyable to listen to.

N/A,average,good,average,2,31570233,0,,poor,2,SLA256,Bad bad prof. Entire course is based on memorization of weird details of random texts which you don't really care about (and not gonna use this knowledge like ever in your life). Tests are tricky and you won't have time to complete all the questions (65 questions in 2 hours? Cmon). One of the hardest courses I took in UofT (I'm in Rotman 4th yr).,04/11/2019,5.0,5.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1554941543000,No,1484,No,,N/A,"['Get ready to read', 'Test heavy', 'Tough grader']",people,people
