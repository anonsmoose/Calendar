Not Mandatory,good,average,good,1,27074182,0,,awesome,5,MIE258,This guy is amazing. He's still a PhD student but teaches better than any other prof I've had this year. The fact that he gives the lecture notes and says we need only them and nothing else is out of this world because of how clear they are and how many great examples they have. Hope he continues teaching this course when prof Sinclair retires.,10/25/2016,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1477358967000,Yes,1484,Yes,,INC,"['Hilarious', 'Accessible outside class', 'Amazing lectures']",people,person
