The course was reading heavy but if you go to lecture and note down the passages he talks about, the exam isn't too much of an issue.

Compared to my other English lit classes though, this one is definitely on the harder side. There's a LOT of material, and I didn't like how the final exam was structured comparing it to UtM's for the same course.

He's very easy to get in touch with but gives A LOT of readings. Most of them are poems but some are very long plays/&quot;Books&quot;. Also suggested to the class during a lecture to LITERALLY cut one of our textbooks in half so it wouldn't be heavy for us.,11/25/2019,3.0,3.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1574699064000,No,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Accessible outside class', 'Get ready to read']",people,people

He puts a lot of works on the syllabus but its definitely just because he's so excited about the course. As long as you generally know what's going on in them you'll be fine. I would definitely take another one of his classes.,12/10/2018,3.0,3.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1544474504000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Lecture heavy', 'Caring', 'Get ready to read']",people,person
