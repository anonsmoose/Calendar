He spoke down to his students, he was boring, he lacked any social skill what-so-ever, and his readings were ridiculous.

He posts lecture outlines on Blackboard in advance of the class, and is almost always perfectly on point. He has a wide breadth off knowledge not limited to engineering or history of technology. I've taken two of his classes, and I would highly recommend him.",01/28/2009,3.0,3.0,,5,Really into it,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1233181148000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],person,people
