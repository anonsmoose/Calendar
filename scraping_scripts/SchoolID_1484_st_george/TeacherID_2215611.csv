Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,32669580,0,,awesome,5,APS360,"Favourite prof at U of T. Honestly he really cares about his students and if I could take more of his classes I would. He takes the time to hold additional office hours. As an industrial engineering student who has less coding experience, he made the tutorials and code sufficient to perform labs and projects. Highly recommend taking this course.",12/15/2019,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1576450372000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,[],people,people
Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,32669562,0,,awesome,5,APS360,The professor really cares about his students. The structure of the course is very well thought out as it is practical and useful for real world applications. Response below is inaccurate as the workload is similar to every other ECE courses.

Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,32371855,0,,awful,1,APS360,An Introduction to Machine learning where the majority of the labs are lifted from another more advanced class. Has approximately double the workload of most engineering classes to the point where almost every deliverable had to have its due date extended twice. Teaches straight from the slides. Syntax heavy. Tests ! Teaches.,11/07/2019,4.0,4.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1573085193000,No,1484,Yes,,B-,['Lots of homework'],people,people
