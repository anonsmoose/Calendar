Mandatory,average,good,average,0,27623764,0,,poor,2,HMB422,"Greatly disappointed at how the course was handled. Assessments did not reflect the purpose of HMB422 as he focused on Neuroscience & not Health and Disease. Good lectures, but tests unnecessarily detailed & did not focus on general concepts to be learned from course. Harshly deducts marks despite strictly following instructions. Reconsider taking.",12/26/2016,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1482751604000,No,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Tough grader', 'Group projects', 'So many papers']",people,people
