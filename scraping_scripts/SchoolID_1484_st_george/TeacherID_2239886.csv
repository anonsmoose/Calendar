Mandatory,good,good,good,0,32121673,0,,awesome,5,CRI225,Adriel is incredible. I'm honoured to have been in her class. She's the real deal; a defence attorney who's even appeared at the Supreme Court of Canada. True badass. Her lectures are riveting and she's SUCH a fair marker. She also cares so much about her students. She remarked my paper on her time off and raised my mark by 13%.

We covered some difficult concepts but she was always able to explain things in ways that anyone could understand. She is always happy to take questions and to explain things again if you don't get the material right away.

Goes out of her way to help each student learn and grow. Almost had to drop the class because I was sick but I was able to navigate through it with her guidance.
