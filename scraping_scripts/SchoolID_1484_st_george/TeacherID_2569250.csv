Slides reading is served, don't waste time going to every class except tutotrials. Poor course design as you can just study the slides and cases while syllabus requires a textbook. The assignments, quizes, and exam were A LOT and unfair.

Mandatory,good,average,good,0,32865473,0,,awesome,5,CRI225,She's absolutely amazing. The course itself is very interesting but she explains things well. Attending all lectures are really important if you want to do well but that's all you honestly need to do well: just attend the lectures and do the assignments.
