Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,23300968,0,,poor,1,PSL300,He talked very fast so I had to relisten to all of his recordings. Also he gave off the feeling that he didn't prepare the lectures slides himself and were substituting for another prof because he would take slides out during the lecture. But on the actual midterm and tests his questions were pretty fair and straight from the lecture notes.,05/22/2014,2.0,2.0,,2,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,1400790154000,N/A,1484,N/A,,A+,[],people,people
