However, approx. 60% of the grade was assigned in the last 2 days, so there was no mark breakdown. My mark (as well as those of my peers) plummeted (89% on midterm; 75% in course) and Fatemi was useless in explaining why.",12/17/2013,3.0,3.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,1387281981000,N/A,1484,N/A,,B,[],people,people
