What I love about Reza is that he has is own style of design, but he values other students' design styles. He is super helpful and approachable as well, and is always ready with ideas to push your design forward.",04/10/2018,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1523367393000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A,"['Caring', 'Gives good feedback', 'Hilarious']",people,people

I took this course during the summer and Im glad I had Reza as my prof because summer school is stressful. Reza was always available in class, out of class, thru email. His feedback and even criticism is always constructive. You will learn a lot from Reza, he is amazing!",04/04/2018,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1522865212000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A,"['Gives good feedback', 'Caring', 'Inspirational']",people,people
N/A,good,average,good,4,29363212,0,,awesome,5,ARC201,The nicest prof I've ever had! Very patient with each student and took good amount of time to give suggestions and feedbacks. He carried markers and pens around and drew good conceptual drawings to help you gather ideas. Had good knowledge about architecture and was willing to share them rather than showed off during reviews.,12/31/2017,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1514684868000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Clear grading criteria', 'Caring', 'Accessible outside class']",people,people
