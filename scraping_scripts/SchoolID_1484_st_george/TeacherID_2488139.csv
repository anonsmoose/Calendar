Lectures are organized, funny, and an incredible learning experience. I like that he gives tests throughout the semester and students can see their progress instead of only 1 final. Love classical music? Take this class:)",05/03/2019,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1556843458000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Group projects', 'Test heavy', 'Amazing lectures']",people,people
