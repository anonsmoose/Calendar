Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,23064796,0,,good,2,MAT334,I had Jesse for MAT237 and MAT334. His classes concentrate on the theoretical side of the course more than is necessary. This was especially the case in 334 in which one was not required to do proofs for tests - just computation. Jesse's classes did not help me do well on the tests. The textbook did. Classes should concentrate more on examples.,04/19/2014,3.0,3.0,,5,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,1397951150000,N/A,1484,N/A,,A,[],people,people
