I never cared about American history before taking his class; he's inspired me to take more and perhaps even pursue it for grad school. Lectures were always so interesting, he really knew how to engage the class. Also very approachable, so asking for help was never an issue. 10/10 would recommend!",01/07/2020,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1578381232000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Respected', 'Amazing lectures', 'Accessible outside class']",people,people

He feels passionate about what he teaches (Mass Incarceration and the US prison system). He's reasonable with marking but pushes you to improve on your work. Attend classes and participate, that was a good chunk of the marking.
