While some lectures get bogged down in dry names and dates, Pagliaroli is always quick to throw in an anecdote or a comment about wine. He is fairly new to lecturing, but deals well with the material. Over all, a great guy, always funny, and eager to engage the class",12/03/2007,2.0,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1196681339000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
