Not Mandatory,average,average,average,1,31505490,0,,poor,2,KPE200,I don't know if it was Fusco or the class but such a hard class to enjoy. Felt like a repeat of KPE100 with just a few more points that should have just been included in 100. Lecture slides were not simplified and were just as difficult to understand as the readings.
