Once he got angry at the class because almost no one had done the reading, but he is such a positive sweetheart that it still came out positive.

I say that with utmost respect; he pushes his students to truly realize their potential, though that first C  or B- may sting a bit, it's absolutely worth it in the long run when you finally get your A-- and know you've truly earned it.
