Mandatory,good,good,good,1,32029287,0,,good,4,MAT136,"The guy is pretty young and super passionate about math. He's not the best at teaching, he mumbles here and there, however, if you ask him to repeat/clarify something, he gladly will. The course itself is pretty challenging; make sure to read the chapter and do the homework beforehand to get a better understanding from the lecture. Great guy :)",06/15/2019,4.0,4.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1560573958000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"[""Skip class? You won't pass."", 'Accessible outside class', 'Caring']",people,person

He doesn't spoon-feed you. he'd give you a question, let you have a go at it, give you a clue, let you go at it again then go through the entire question and will explain everything clearly.",01/25/2019,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1548433975000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Hilarious', 'Caring', 'Inspirational']",people,people
