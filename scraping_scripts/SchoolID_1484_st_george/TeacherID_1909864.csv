Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,26306297,0,,good,3,CRI350H1,Sytsma is a very divisive professor in the Criminology department some people love her and some really have some mean things to say. For me she has always been fun and engaging. My biggest critique is that exams can be difficult in the sense that some of the questions she asks are from minor points in a single slide,04/15/2016,3.0,3.0,,4,N/A,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,1460737606000,N/A,1484,Yes,,A-,['Lecture heavy'],people,people
