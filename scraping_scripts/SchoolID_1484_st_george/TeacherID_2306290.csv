The course was relatively straight forward and a bit bland. You really gotta just read the textbook and know the slides. Julie didn't really add much to the course.,12/11/2018,3.0,3.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1544488942000,Yes,1484,Yes,,Not sure yet,['Graded by few things'],people,people
Mandatory,good,good,good,1,28964781,0,,good,4,RSM321,Julie was a good prof and what i liked about her is that she told us what to focus on for the midterm/final. The course is super hard so do ALL the homework and ASK questions when you are confused! She can go a bit fast sometimes and may forget to ask the class if they understand the madness she just taught. It's really the content. not the prof,11/26/2017,5.0,5.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1511740614000,Yes,1484,Yes,,Not sure yet,"['Lots of homework', 'Test heavy', ""Skip class?
