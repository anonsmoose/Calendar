Mandatory,good,average,good,0,27934206,0,,awesome,5,HIS298,Chris is super passionate and down to earth. He's the kind of professor who 100% treats you more as a peer than a student. His lectures are really interesting and he leaves lots of room for discussion. The only downside is that sometimes he gets a little behind the syllabus so you might not know what week's readings he'll quiz you on. He's amazing!,03/22/2017,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1490199764000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Beware of pop quizzes', 'Inspirational', 'Caring']",people,people
