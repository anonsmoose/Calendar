VERY organized; course had two instructors but was better administered than many others with only one. Friendly & approachable. Tests are unique and challenging; open-book with fact patterns.

But the other lecturer in this course is not quite as much, so I find that many students show up for his class but you can see that there are significantly fewer students when the other teaches.

The lectures and readings are similar, but complimentary, so both are necessary for success.
