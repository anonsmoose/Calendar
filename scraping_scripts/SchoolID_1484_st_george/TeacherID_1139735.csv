Agreed w/ the previous reviewer that she seems like she's just winging it. Course is good b/c there are a bunch of films and she rarely tests on the content of the readings. Her TA marks easy and is flexible on extensions though!",06/15/2019,4.0,4.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,No,1560632000000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A+,['Respected'],people,people

Her lectures are horrible and she gives the impression that she cares more about her own research and whatever else than she does about teaching.
