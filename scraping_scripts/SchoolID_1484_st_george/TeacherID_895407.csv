N/A,poor,average,poor,0,12257321,0,,poor,1,AST101,Has a way heavier accent than Marten Van Kerkwijk & speaks as quickly as possible (faster too). Flips through slides before students can barely even look at it. Impossible to take notes or listen--understand! Rushes through everything because he knows nobody cares; nobody understands what he's saying or both. At least Van Kerkwijk was enthusiastic.,09/29/2006,3.0,3.0,,2,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,1159495384000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
