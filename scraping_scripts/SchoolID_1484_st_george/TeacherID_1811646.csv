Not Mandatory,good,average,good,1,25043623,0,,awesome,5,ENG239H1,"     Kai is a great instructor. I've spent most of my time at oft trying to get into Fantasy and Horror and my only complaints are with how the school chooses to  run the course:only one section offered, too short, etc. Kai is fun, well-spoken, and very good with creative assignments. 1010 would take again and again",07/15/2015,2.0,2.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,No,1437000926000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A,"['Inspirational', 'Participation matters']",people,person

And she's not afraid to humiliate you in front of the entire class. The best part is that her readings are demanding and excessive.
