Mandatory,good,average,good,0,26395736,0,,awesome,5,RLG308,Bugg is a great lecturer & keeps you engaged throughout the 2 hours. Short readings are assigned so she expects you to do them and engage in class discussion. The only bad part of this course is that the TA was a VERY tough marker and didn't provide sufficient feedback to help you improve.
