N/A,good,average,good,2,28769427,0,,awesome,5,MAT223,You can tell that he's brilliant but can explain things on a fundamental/basic level. He's very accessible and genuinely tries to help his students understand the material. I never had to refer to a textbook because his lecture notes were clear and succinct. He really knows his stuff and it shows! Awesome prof. He deserves all the best in future.,10/22/2017,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1508681907000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Caring', 'Inspirational', 'Hilarious']",people,people

I think he is fresh at teaching, but I can see that he tries really hard to improve his lectures so that the class can easily understand him. It can be difficult to deliver a new abstract concept. He actually cares about us!!! Wishing him all the best for the future.",10/03/2017,3.0,3.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1506993082000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Respected', 'Amazing lectures', 'Inspirational']",people,people
Mandatory,good,average,good,1,28689450,0,,awesome,5,MAT223,"best lecturer ive had in my math career at uoft, his lectures are so clear and so organized. He wrote full, in detail lecture notes for our class in 223 for 11 chapters. A real gem that man is. He's also really awesome at relating what we learn to real life scenarios, makes math so much more fun!
