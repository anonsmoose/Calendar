Mandatory,average,average,average,0,32301829,0,,poor,2,GGR241,I'm not sure how they let her teach this course. She read off the jot-notes on the slides made by the Professor who designed the course (which means she often read grammatically incorrect gibberish without realizing it half the time). Her assignments also are super unclear. I think it would be better if she gave the course her own spin.,10/21/2019,3.0,3.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1571631619000,No,1484,Yes,,A,['Graded by few things'],people,people
