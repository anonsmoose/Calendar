However this past year she seemed only half interested in teaching. Instead of challenging students she would just automatically give answers for us to recite in unison.

This is not  a bird and if you don't put in a lot of time, say goodbye to your GPA. Take EAS110 or EAS210 for bird. Only thing I did not like was the final exam; very long and difficult exam that brought everyone marks down.",04/25/2015,3.0,3.0,,3,Low,3.5,3.5,1,No,1429949465000,N/A,1484,Yes,,A-,"['Tough grader', ""Skip class?

I was getting high 80s in this course before the final exam, but the final exam was ridiciously hard. Over 10 pages, with lots of questions AND 2 essay questions WITHIN 2 HOURS.

Quizzes every week along with presentations, book reports, essays etc.. If your Korean isn't strong, you will spend alot of hours on work. ALSO, she makes you talk on the spot with questions, so be PREPARED to talk. Plus you can't skip bc of quizzes..",03/27/2015,2.0,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.0,4.0,1,No,1427451171000,N/A,1484,Yes,,N/A,[],people,people
