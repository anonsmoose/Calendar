Frankly, it was cruel of him to assign a book we used for only a few weeks that costs $80+. Besides that, he explains things well and you'll like the class if you care about income inequality.",12/04/2017,2.0,2.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,No,1512422677000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A+,[],people,person

N/A,average,good,average,0,24671521,0,,good,3,SOC395H1F,This class was okay but sometimes I found it dull. The TA and the professor have high standards so you have to work hard. I did find the instructions for the final paper to be convoluted.

Prof. Wodtke really gets you to think critically about the material and class theory.  His lectures are very clear, interesting and easy to follow.
