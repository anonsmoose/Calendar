Didn't give good cues as to what was important. I agree with the other comment that a lot of what he said is oversimplified. Tutorials for this class are a godsend though.

He did not pay enough attention to general themes and concepts of the course material and made no effort to connect the different themes in an interesting way. Burgess does not work with the course to fulfil the requirements of a university level course and I am glad I am done with it.
