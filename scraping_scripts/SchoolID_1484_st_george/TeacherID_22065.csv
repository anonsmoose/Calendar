Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,31348290,0,,poor,2,MAT1061HS,I took a PDE course with this guy a while ago. The course basically turned into a physics course. The guy is a mathematical physicist pretending to be a mathematician and gets visibly agitated when you ask him to provide more rigour/details for a result.
