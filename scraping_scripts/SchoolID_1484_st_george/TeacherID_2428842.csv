Questions are extreme versions of course content not discussed before. Test was very unreasonable compared to what was taught. I understood all lecture material, studied, and went for extra help, but still failed regardless.",10/08/2019,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1570562279000,Yes,1484,Yes,,WD,"['Get ready to read', 'Test heavy', 'Accessible outside class']",people,people
Mandatory,good,average,good,0,32077242,0,,good,4,PSY202,Professor Metz was a great professor. This class was much more manageable than PSY201. The exams were straightforward and there were no surprises. The textbook is only useful for the weekly quizes. Her slides are well organized and the exams are pretty much lecture-based. Highly recommend!,07/04/2019,3.0,3.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1562234354000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A,['Group projects'],people,people
