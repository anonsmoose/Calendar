Easy course overall if you just attend the lectures, but that's because he explains it so well. Otherwise if you were to do the readings on your own, it'll be a hard course. He skateboards to get to class!",04/08/2011,2.0,2.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,No,1302299687000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
