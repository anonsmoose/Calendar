N/A,poor,good,poor,0,19080693,0,,awful,1,POL203,"THE WORST TEACHER AT THIS SCHOOL. Consistently an A student, he marked my assignment and gave me a 49/100. Took it to the TA and I received an 81. That's a 32 mark difference. Skipped over things, paid no attention to points made. Highly arrogant. Avoid.",10/17/2011,5.0,5.0,,1,Meh,1.0,1.0,1,No,1318882659000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

The readings were all over the place. Rarely used the expensive text. Not engaging at all. Danced around topics instead of hitting us straight on. Very frustrating. The TAs sucked except for Matt.",04/14/2011,5.0,5.0,,1,Low,1.0,1.0,1,No,1302824711000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
