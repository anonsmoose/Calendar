N/A,good,good,good,0,16143498,0,,awesome,5,MATA37,I had Joe as a Calculus TA at Scarborough campus. He spends a lot of time taking care of individual students' questions and exploring problems. He does a great job of giving people the tools to solve problems -- those that are interested. The students who ignored him and sat in the back of the room were ignored in turn. Very good TA.,08/23/2009,4.0,4.0,,5,It's my life,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1250992746000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
