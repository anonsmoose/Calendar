Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,28217308,0,,awful,1,SMC229,This professor was very condescending and not easy to approach. She would make unnecessary comments about students who did not attend class and was often brash and unapproachable. She had a suggestion box for the first two classes and got rid of it when she got a suggestion she didn't like.
