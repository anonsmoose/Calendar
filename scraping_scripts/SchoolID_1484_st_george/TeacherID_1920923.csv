It definitely helps to have some background in music as she doesn't go over the basics for long, but that said, she is very approachable and helpful if you don't get something. Very knowledgeable and passionate about music!",09/07/2016,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1473254806000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A+,"['Clear grading criteria', 'Lecture heavy', 'Caring']",people,person

Might be confusing if you have no music experience, but she is more than happy to explain details that you do not understand during lecture or after. Very fun class -- switched my minor to music because of her lecture ",09/21/2014,3.0,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1411266295000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,['Amazing lectures'],people,person
