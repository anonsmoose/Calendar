Mandatory,good,average,good,1,31903077,0,,awesome,5,GGR339,Prof Spicier was a great professor for GGR339. His lectures were interesting and engaging. The quizzes were a bit difficult because they were fill-in-the-blank but they weren't worth much. Final wasn't bad either. Nothing unexpected from the course. It's a great course to sit back and really take in the information. + Prof. Spicier is hilarious!,05/17/2019,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1558125951000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A-,"['Hilarious', 'Amazing lectures', 'Clear grading criteria']",people,person
