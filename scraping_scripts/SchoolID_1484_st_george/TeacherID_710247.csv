N/A,average,good,poor,0,18335723,0,,poor,2,ECO100Y,"He can not teach. Does not explain anything clearly. His tests are extremely unfair. I would not recommend anybody to take this coarse with him. Many &quot;real&quot; life examples that he gives are not applicable anywhere in the tests. He has a horrible handwriting and goes through important material very fast.
