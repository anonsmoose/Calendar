Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,32490657,0,,poor,2,NMC196,confused for all the assignments because she doesn't provide any prompt or direction so u have to ask for clarification on everything: the worst part. DO NOT take this class if ur not obsessed w archaeology/anthropology I took it bc I thought it was about law but we spent 2 hrs talking about the significance of a dining hall smh #gotagoodgradetho,11/29/2019,3.0,3.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1575003771000,No,1484,No,,N/A,"['Get ready to read', 'Accessible outside class', 'Graded by few things']",people,people

She gives you plenty of opportunities to do well in the class (you write an essay and do a creative costume project). The exam is super fair, she posts slides and most of the lectures are based on class discussion. That being said I didn't go to class often and I still got an A.

I would definitely take another NMC course again. I really liked how we learned different takes on certain artifacts or concepts. The assignments were also very unique and actually fun to do.,01/14/2019,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1547499604000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Gives good feedback', 'Clear grading criteria', ""Skip class?

Best lecture featured her debunking outlandish alien theories re: monumental architecture. Great variety of projects and the final was exactly what she said it was going to be. No textbooks, 2+ articles prep per lecture that you read.",01/10/2019,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1547147675000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A+,"['Clear grading criteria', 'Gives good feedback', 'Participation matters']",people,people
