Some reading assignments were never mentioned in class. Very monotone & didn't try to promote enthusiasm or class discussion. Rare instances he did ask questions, they'd make no sense.

His language  barrier prevents him from properly understanding students' questions. He would fail as a litigator, since he can't get the point.

He has a hard time understanding what you are trying to say, and if it isn't worded exactly as he is thinking about it, he doesn't get it.
