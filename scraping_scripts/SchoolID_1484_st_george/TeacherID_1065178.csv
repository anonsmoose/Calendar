Mandatory,good,average,good,4,28050961,0,,awesome,5,TBB199,Individual and Society: The nicest prof in my first year. If you hate reading don't bother with this course; 80-100pgs per week but it's all for discussion not tested except for some key ideas on the midterm. The readings are dense but he does a great job of clarifying. He made us all brownies on the last day.

I've never had a prof take such a judicious approach to tests (even if you didn't give the exact answer he sought, he gave some marks if you knew something). He welcomed class discussions/debates. He really wants students to think and learn, even if disagreeing with the standard school of thought.
