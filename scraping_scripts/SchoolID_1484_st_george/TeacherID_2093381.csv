Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,25806088,0,,good,3,MAT135H1,This prof is very helpful. He teaches a concept and then gives like 5 mins in class for a question for students to try and attempt it on their own and keeps asking if it is clear. In the meantime he walks around class and asks for individual questions. However sometimes he gets caught up in his own explanation which sometimes gets confusing.,12/22/2015,3.0,3.0,,4,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,1450814798000,N/A,1484,Yes,,A-,"['Caring', 'Hilarious', 'Respected']",people,people
