He is just biased that education is important- not open to any other opinion. he said we would get a 10 on 10 if we had almost complete essay for the rough draft submission. i had a completed paper but only got an 8 which was really unfair. He also graded us very hard on the midterm.,11/07/2011,5.0,5.0,,1,Really into it,1.5,1.5,1,No,1320695812000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,person
