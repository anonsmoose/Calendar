She was enthusiastic about the material and was helpful when it came time to have our papers done. I would take her class again in a heart beat. It was not a super easy course, but it was a fun challenge and I left having learned a lot. She uses her own book - it's a great resours",04/13/2016,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1460555032000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A-,"['Inspirational', 'Gives good feedback']",people,people
