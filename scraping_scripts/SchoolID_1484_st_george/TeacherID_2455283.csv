Mandatory,good,good,good,1,31592594,0,,good,4,MAT136,I think she tries very hard to give good lectures. She is super helpful when I ask questions after class and very approachable. Looking back at the slides I think she put a lot of work into them. I found the class confusing and the lecture could be clearer still but it's math (and I suck at math) so I think it's not really her fault.,04/15/2019,4.0,4.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1555300220000,No,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Gives good feedback', 'Accessible outside class', 'Caring']",people,person

Never writes stuff herself to help us understand. Doesn't really talk a lot of about the exam, just teaches the things she has to teach for the day.
