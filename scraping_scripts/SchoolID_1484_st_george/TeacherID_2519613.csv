Mandatory,average,good,average,0,32260572,0,,poor,2,HIS282,I wouldn't recommend taking his classes. He's very quiet and it's almost impossible to hear anything he says. His lectures are very boring. His PowerPoints are also far too wordy and he goes by them very quickly. Not to mention he said we can't ask any clarifications about the essay questions we were given.,10/03/2019,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1570079627000,No,1484,Yes,,Not sure yet,"[""Skip class?
