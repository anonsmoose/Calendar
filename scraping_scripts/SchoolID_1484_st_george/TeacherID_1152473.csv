Not Mandatory,poor,poor,poor,0,32523533,0,,awful,1,ENV223,"This class is so useless and confusing. Professor Bass never has clear criteria for projects. He is very angry in emails but then confusingly cheerful in class. It is a very easy class, but it is causes a lot of frustration. We NEVER use the textbook, so do not bother buying it.
