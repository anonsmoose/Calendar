So I took NMC103: The Islamic World with Dr. Nejatie and found the course to be really interesting in terms of the material. It was the prof's first time teaching the course and he didnt do too bad of a job. The assignments arent't super clear, basically you just have a reading and are supposed to write an essay about it.",01/08/2020,2.0,2.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,No,1578501271000,No,1484,Yes,,A,['Get ready to read'],people,people

Teaching a course regarding Islam, he tends to disregard the fact that displaying images of the Prophet is highly offensive and uses images frequently. Often explains too many details and leaves out what we need for assignments",12/03/2019,3.0,3.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1575414465000,No,1484,No,,N/A,"['Get ready to read', 'Lots of homework', 'Lecture heavy']",people,people
