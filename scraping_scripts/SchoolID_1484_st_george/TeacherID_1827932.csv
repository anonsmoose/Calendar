She is clearly passionate about what she is teaching, and makes lectures interesting and engaging. Class participation and peer related activities were encouraged, and she was very clear about what she expected from assignments.

Very available to students and very helpful. However, HEAVY work load. 1- 3 things due every week, which became stressful when other courses began piling up.

She consistently delivers in lecture on a wide range of topics and is able to intersect a variety of critical approaches. She puts her students first and will go above and beyond to accommodate them, putting as much (or more) into the course as you will.

Mandatory,average,good,average,1,22902276,0,,average,3,ENG252Y1,She is really nice however she tends to rant a lot about things that don't seem that important. She also always keeps us after time and barely gives us a break.. Attendance is mandatory and she gives us assignments that we have due every class. It's kind of annoying and makes me not want to attend. I have a hard time focusing and have lost interest,03/11/2014,4.0,4.0,,3,Meh,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1394552021000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,person
