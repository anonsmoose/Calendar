Mandatory,average,good,average,0,32068727,0,,average,3,ANT348,Gives lots of feedback but has incredibly high standards. Uses a lot of academic language which can make her explanations and test questions vague and confusing. When asked to clarify she doesn't know how to use plain language so you're left even more confused. Can come across condescending but I think she's a good person.,06/30/2019,4.0,4.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1561924910000,No,1484,Yes,,B+,"['Respected', 'Lecture heavy', 'Tough grader']",people,people

She was very approachable and always ready to answer any questions. Exams were straightforward and built upon past assignments and class discussions, so no surprises. Really interesting readings too.

I have tried to speak to her multiple times but she was always very condescending, which makes it difficult to ask for clarification ESPECIALLY if you're introverted. Her choice of TA isn't any better in my opinion. I can't drop this class because I need but oh my gosh don't take it as an elective.",11/07/2017,4.0,4.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1510091520000,No,1484,N/A,,N/A,"['Participation matters', 'Graded by few things', 'Get ready to read']",person,people
