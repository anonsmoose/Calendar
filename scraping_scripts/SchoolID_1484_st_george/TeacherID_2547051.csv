Mandatory,average,average,average,0,32670247,0,,average,3,AST101,"Nice guy, you can tell he's interested in what he's teaching and he tries to make the class engaging. However his lectures often got a bit dreary and monotonous, but that was due largely to the content which gets extremely boring at times. Clicker questions mean coming to class is important, but you're allowed to miss 4 lectures without penalty.",12/16/2019,3.0,3.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,No,1576454560000,No,1484,Yes,,N/A,[],people,people
Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,32519596,0,,awesome,5,AST101,"Very nice guy. The course is a very simple intro course and everything you need is posted online (since they only test what's on the slides), so the prof really isn't needed. He tries to stay somewhat engaging to make up for this since everyone's forced to go to do the clicker quizzes.",12/04/2019,1.0,1.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1575443501000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A+,[],people,people
Mandatory,average,good,average,0,32516395,0,,poor,2,AST101,"Well-educated and thorough. Tried his best to engage with students and be understandable. But, monotone and not engaging, and material could be difficult to stay on top of. Textbook is unnecessary, but you must pay close attention to lecture because of the clicker quizzes. Not a great prof, but not terrible either.",12/04/2019,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1575421874000,No,1484,Yes,,A,[],people,people
