If you like thinking differently then this class is for you. However, this class is an easy A with the extra credit you can take. The work load is fair and only a midterm and final which are straight forward. ",01/08/2015,2.0,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1420761098000,N/A,1484,Yes,,A-,[],people,people

Although some assignments were tough, as long as you read the books, which are pretty interesting, you should be fine. She is also somewhat of a tough grader, but she offers a lot of super easy extra credit. This class was really interesting and Lindsay is super cool and funny.  I would take it again.

She told the class that she only gives out A's if it is exceptionally perfect. She does not care about your grade at all. Way too much work for final also!
