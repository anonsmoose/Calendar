He genuinely cares for the students, and wants to help. PLUS he's pretty hot so if you get bored you can just stare at his face, though you rarely get bored in his class :D. I really liked him. wooohoooo!",01/23/2011,2.0,2.0,,5,Really into it,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1295803547000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,person

His quizs seem to be difficult but the marks always end up really high. He made me love German. PLUS he looks sooo cute. It's so enjoyable to be in his class. Haha maybe his appearance is distracting me. :-D",10/23/2010,2.0,2.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,1287853778000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
