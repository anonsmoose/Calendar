It isn't a good sign when he begins *every other lecture* with &quot;Okay, let's get started, we have a lot to cover today&quot; before speeding through it all - that's stressful. Don't bother reading the Brophy textbook until you start exam-studying.",05/18/2009,4.0,4.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,1242661698000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

I liked that he was to the point, but also interjected a little humour into his lectures. He usually accompanied every lecture with some slides (pictures, maps, etc.) which was helpful.
