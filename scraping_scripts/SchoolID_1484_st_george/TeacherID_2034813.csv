His assignments are clearly laid out from the beginning. Don't neglect to think them through early on - creativity and thorough thought are important, and good spelling and grammar will take you far.

The downsides of this course are assignments that are barely reflective of and are remotely related to the course content. Pungente is an approachable, understanding, and helpful instructor. He is very keen on grammar, so make sure your writing is good. ",08/19/2015,2.0,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.0,4.0,1,No,1439954868000,N/A,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Group projects', ""Skip class?
