Kevin is actually a decent professor but the course material is just too damn hard. Everything was counterintuitive to me, and I had to end up memorizing a lot in hopes of getting a decent grade.

If you skip class you can still figure the material out from his slides and problem sets which are SUPER easy .

Make sure you carefully study the problem sets and understand the solutions while going over the lecture slides.
