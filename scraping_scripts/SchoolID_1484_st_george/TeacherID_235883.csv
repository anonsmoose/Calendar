Not Mandatory,good,average,good,1,30309462,0,,awesome,5,CSC320,"Definitely one of my favorite professors in UofT. Kyros gives amazing lectures, derive most formulas by hand and explains every concept well. What's more, the content of the course itself is not only interesting but also useful. Although the test somewhat hard, the final grade will be fine due to a big curve.
