Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25619024,1,,awesome,5,PS261,I really enjoyed Dr. Miller's lectures this year. He is very clear and consistent with his teaching and if you focus well and write down what he says you will do well in the course. He gives great examples and made a 3 hour lecture go by a lot faster. I will definitely take more classes with him in the future.,12/09/2015,2.0,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5.0,5.0,1,No,1449702284000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"[""Skip class?
