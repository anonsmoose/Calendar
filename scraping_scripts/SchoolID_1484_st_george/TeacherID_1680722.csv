Not Mandatory,good,average,good,1,29839933,3,,awesome,5,ECO326,Lectures is enjoyable. Makes jokes and examples often. Tests are very similar to past exams in which he posts the answers to. Exams are really not hard if u actually tried to understand the concept. And he keeps the avg to around 78-80 so. Dats pretty high. Managed to get 94% on the finals despite getting around 70 on midterm.,04/19/2018,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1524114107000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A,"['Amazing lectures', 'Clear grading criteria']",people,person

I really love how he cares about his students by constantly asking us if we understand what he has been teaching.

Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,24351279,0,,good,4,ECO2020,His teaching style is dynamic and keeps you awake. He is clear and rigorous which is very important for microeconomics. The only problem of this course are the problem sets :They are so long that you have to give up studying for other courses.   (and they are graded so you have to do them).,02/01/2015,5.0,5.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1422822193000,N/A,1484,Yes,,N/A,[],people,people
