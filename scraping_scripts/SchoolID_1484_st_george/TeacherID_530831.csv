Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,27537914,1,,awesome,5,ECE302,Great prof. He always made everything clear and related course material to real applications (something that is surprisingly rare at U of T's APPLIED science department). He also did a 10min review of the previous lecture at the beginning of each lecture so people weren't completely lost if they were half asleep during the last session.,12/16/2016,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1481920745000,Yes,1484,Yes,,Not sure yet,"['Caring', 'Amazing lectures', 'Respected']",person,people

His problem sets are not a good indiciation of what to expect on the midterm since he makes something that was covered for 2 minutes in class to be half the exam.
