The issue with her teaching is that the curriculum she has created for the course is a recreation of some sort of fantasy. This lack of realism is toxic and I don't think she sees it. She doesn't help you dig deeper into your consciousness but tries to build a non-existent fantasy and imposes it onto you.",10/14/2019,1.0,1.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1571088873000,No,1484,Yes,,N/A,[],people,people
