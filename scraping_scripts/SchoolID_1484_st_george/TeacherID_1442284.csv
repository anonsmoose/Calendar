Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,3,22175206,0,,awful,1,SOC202H1,I have no idea why he is still teaching. He was absolutely horrible. Talked about his pHD the entire time and spent very little time actually explaining course materials. If you are stuck with him study the textbook material closely and skip his lectures. I am not exaggerating when I say he was one of the most unprofessional profs ive ever seen.,10/13/2013,3.0,3.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1381641537000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
N/A,poor,good,poor,0,19079578,0,,awful,1,SOC202,"Every class he brings around 100 slides, and just quickly skims through a quarter or half, if lucky, of them. He doesn't care if you understand the material, he just wants you to memorize them. The only reason I got an A while majority of the class failed was because I stopped attending his lectures, junked his slides and just read the text book!",10/17/2011,5.0,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1318867773000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
