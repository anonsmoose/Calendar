Teaches you the concepts, and tests you on them fairly. Office hours are very useful and productive. He is very clear on what he wants to test you on, and how you can prepare. He doesn't focus entirely on details, its all about understanding.",12/19/2016,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1482112631000,Yes,1484,N/A,,N/A,"['Accessible outside class', 'Hilarious', 'Clear grading criteria']",people,people
