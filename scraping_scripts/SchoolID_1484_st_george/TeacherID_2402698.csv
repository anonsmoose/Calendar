HPS200 is a fairly easy course but the subject matter is really interesting if you're interested in philosophy but find some first/second-year PHL courses to be too meta (meaning not applicable to the real world).,12/13/2018,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1544734936000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A+,"['Amazing lectures', 'Clear grading criteria', 'Get ready to read']",people,people
