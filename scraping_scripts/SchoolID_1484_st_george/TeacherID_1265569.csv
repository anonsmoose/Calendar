Readings are interesting, but tests are marked ridiculously hard. I normally get A's, got a C+ in her class. She's just starting out so she's probably trying to prove something, she might become more reasonable over time. goodluck!",03/29/2009,4.0,4.0,,2,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,No,1238349708000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,person
