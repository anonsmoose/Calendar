N/A,good,average,good,1,3582179,0,,awesome,5,ABS201,One of the best profs ever.  Lectures get off topic often and could use some visuals.  Prof is approachable and definately doesn't have the over inflated ego many UofT profs have. Class could use a website for marks and stuff.  Good times in the class as he's known to crack a few good jokes. :D,04/07/2005,3.0,3.0,,5,Really into it,5.0,5.0,1,N/A,1112908130000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,person
