Mandatory,good,average,good,0,32532807,0,,awesome,5,CRI490,This was one of my favorite classes by far in all 4 years at U of T. I took this course w. no interest in immigration but Professor Tran changed all that. She is A GODDESS on this otherwise abysmal campus. Knew all the students by name and her lectures were inspiring and fascinating. Take her class you won't regret it,12/05/2019,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1575523570000,Yes,1484,Yes,,B,"['Inspirational', 'Participation matters', 'Accessible outside class']",people,people

I didn't know much about immigration before taking this class but the topics she teaches and the way she teaches them always keep the class focused. She's organized, inspirational and caring. The readings are actually pretty interesting too.

It isn't about memorizing or taking exams but actually understanding the material and applying to real-life issues. Her assignments make you to think about the class lectures in a way that you haven't before. Prof. Tran is amazing and so smart but also so humble!,11/09/2019,5.0,5.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1573278658000,Yes,1484,Yes,,B+,"['Respected', 'Amazing lectures', 'Caring']",people,person

Expectations from Grace is ambiguous and the assignments are rather a nuisance than beneficial which will hurt your grade.
