Mandatory,good,average,good,0,32134019,0,,awesome,5,ENG100,Currently taking the class with her and its really enjoyable. I really love the way she structures the class with in class writing exercises and also encourages participation. Her lectures are pretty refreshing since she makes the memes herself.

Mandatory,good,average,good,1,30616659,0,,good,4,ENG100,I took ENG100 with Katherine Shwetz over Summer 2018. She's young and fun (her slides are full of memes she makes herself). Her teaching style is very fun and is easy to grasp. She makes sure to talk to students individually when she has the time to see how much sense her lessons are making to them.
