Mandatory,poor,average,poor,1,31927046,1,,awful,1,CSC2508,"Nick Koudas is a bad human being. See the other review that's posted. He is a man who lacks empathy and runs his classes like a programmed robot. Easily one of the worst profs I have encountered due to his complete lack of social skills and his vindictive nature, I would advise against taking a class with him.
