Coming from a non-literature background, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy she made the course to understand. She is very knowledgeable and dives into each work with intensity and depth. Needless to say, you have to read a lot of material in this course, but she makes it worthwhile with her insightful lectures.",04/08/2019,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1554685181000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Caring', 'Get ready to read', 'Gives good feedback']",people,people
