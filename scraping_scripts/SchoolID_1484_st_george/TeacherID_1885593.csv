With that being said, she was extremely nice. Participation is mandatory if you want to do well because most of the things that show up on tests are mentioned in the lectures.

Mandatory,good,average,good,0,30773883,0,,awesome,5,EEB214,This semester was the first where the course switched to the 5 quizzes format instead of 1 midterm &amp; 1 exam format of previous years and having your marks split up across multiple evaluations made it easier to study for.
