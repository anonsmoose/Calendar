Mandatory,good,average,good,0,30804499,0,,good,4,PCL473,"Taught one lecture in PCL473. I quite enjoyed it, she is an expert in smoking addiction and nicotine. She does some pretty interesting research . The test questions on her lecture were very easy. I don't think she lectures a lot, but she is very good at it - that's quite something. Overall pretty great, she should teach in more courses.",11/28/2018,2.0,2.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,No,1543419165000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,['Amazing lectures'],people,people
