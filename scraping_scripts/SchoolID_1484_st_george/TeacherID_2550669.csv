Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,32585128,0,,awful,1,ANT207,She is a nice person but she assigns way too many readings. It's actually not possible to finish them unless you want to spend your whole week on one class. Also gave assignments that were due every week to help with the course but these were never marked. Very unorganized person and class. Would not recommend to anyone.,12/10/2019,3.0,3.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1575943101000,No,1484,Yes,,Not sure yet,"['Lots of homework', 'Get ready to read']",people,people

Her class is lecture heavy and she definitely tries to fill the whole time with content, so it's best for people who will do the readings and be prepared. She is a clear speaker. The course cntent was average, challenge-wise.",12/09/2019,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1575872172000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Amazing lectures', 'Get ready to read', 'Caring']",people,people
