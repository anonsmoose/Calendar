Mandatory,good,average,good,3,30447465,0,,awesome,5,GGR339,At first I didnt know anything about this class and only took it because it fit my schedule. I am glad I did because I now am thinking about going into urban planning. Dr Spinks is a very inspirational professor. She took material that could have easily been boring and made me want to learn it. Tip: go to class.

But, she is very approachable and accessible outside of class. She wants you to succeed and is very interested in the subject matter.
