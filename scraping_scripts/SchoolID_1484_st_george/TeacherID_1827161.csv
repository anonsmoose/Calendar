Considering the fact that I only took the course as a degree requirement, I was happily surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Very encouraging and welcoming. To top it all off, I noticed a real improvement in my analysis and essay writing.",07/16/2018,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1531779626000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A,"['Gives good feedback', 'Participation matters']",people,people

Could be because the class was designed for science students. Was not clear at all when it came to expectations for assignments (which were repetitive) and tried to squeeze too many in for a h-course. TA was also bad, only gave repetitive uninsightful feedback.",06/19/2017,3.0,3.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1497873911000,No,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['So many papers', 'Get ready to read', 'Accessible outside class']",person,people
N/A,good,good,good,2,24910353,1,,awesome,4,JEI206H1,Cynthia taught the effects of rhetorical devices so in depth that I began to love the subjects since I realized how important & applicable they are to all aspects of writing. She is very flexible with her schedule & will always squeeze in to see students to discuss assignments & even accommodates those who really need the help.
