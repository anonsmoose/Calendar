Not Mandatory,average,good,average,2,23460366,0,,poor,2,HIS242,I was very interested in 20th c europe before taking this course but prof Barton just ruined it. Her lectures were unorganized & sounded as if she was reading out of the textbook. There was an absurd amount of reading per week and weekly tutorial responses were required. Instructions on assignments were not clear. Most stopped going to lecture.,07/21/2014,4.0,4.0,,2,Really into it,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1405947501000,N/A,1484,N/A,,A-,[],people,people

She lectures from a text book, doesn't put lecture slides up, and talks so fast it's nearly impossible to get everything she said. She also didn't tell us until the mid term that we didn't need to know anything from the text, just lectures. Waste of money and time.
