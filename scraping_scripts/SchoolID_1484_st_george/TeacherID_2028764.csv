The final movie analysis was fun to do but there were no instructions provided as to how to structure the analysis.

The final movie analysis was tough as we weren't given clear instructions as to how to write/structure the paper. Didn't focus much on sexuality &  learned sort of obvious things about gender. I wish race would've been discussed more",12/17/2016,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1481974929000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Clear grading criteria', 'Accessible outside class', 'Caring']",people,people
