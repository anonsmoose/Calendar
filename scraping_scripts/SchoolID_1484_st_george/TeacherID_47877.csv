Not Mandatory,good,average,good,2,25646858,0,,awesome,5,CSB343," Prof Stephenson is an incredible teacher. It's rare to find teachers that are able to explain concepts so thoroughly. You leave the class knowing much more than what was strictly taught in class, because you can extend the concepts learned to other areas of biology. You need to be ready to work hard to do well in the class.
