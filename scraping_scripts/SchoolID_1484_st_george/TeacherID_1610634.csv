Not Mandatory,average,good,poor,1,26500069,1,,poor,2,CSC411,This is a very good class with very horrible lecturer and TAs. The teacher and TAs are the most irresponsible ones I've ever seen. Don't trust the score they give you on your assignment until the final mark. Don't trust that TAs will mark your assignment seriously because many of them are still CONFUSED!!! The teacher is also boring. Don't take it,05/07/2016,4.0,4.0,,1,N/A,1.5,1.5,1,No,1462644668000,N/A,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Inspirational', ""Skip class? You won't pass."", 'Tough grader']",person,person
