Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,31810513,0,,awesome,5,SDS256H1,"Engaging and well spoken prof! Interesting concepts were taught. The difficulty in this course is in the amount of readings but he breaks them down very thoroughly during lecture. Office hours are very informative and he's reasonable with extensions, provided it's not last minute. I'd advise lecture over readings but do try and keep up with them.",05/08/2019,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1557331663000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A+,"['Amazing lectures', 'Get ready to read', ""Skip class?

More anthropological readings than other social sciences, but I enjoyed it nevertheless.
