My favourite part was her assignments - they were really practical and different than your usual assignments, e.g. attending a planning meeting, analysing a public space. They're a little broad but she gives you a lot of wiggle room to write about what you want.",12/21/2015,2.0,2.0,,4,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,1450730232000,Yes,1484,Yes,,N/A,[],people,people
