Mandatory,average,good,average,0,32903746,0,,poor,2,MGY200,Hes great at getting you inspired but getting midterms back everyone was shocked at how poorly we all did. His attitude changed for us when we got the first midterm back. My class was also not dumb I know many kids with 4.0 who didnt do great. You write the midterm so confidently that when you get your mark back you question if it was even yours.,02/11/2020,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1581448193000,No,1484,Yes,,N/A,"['Get ready to read', ""Skip class?

Gave really good advice for undergrads at the beginning of the each lecture too. Conveys ideas easily and will go over them if you do not understand.
