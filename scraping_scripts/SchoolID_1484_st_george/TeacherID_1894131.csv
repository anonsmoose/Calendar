Mandatory,good,average,good,0,23088445,0,,awesome,4,NEW332H1,Awesome course. Had a trip to Zen Temple. Paper on that. Then a test and another paper worth 50%. Pretty straightforward and easy to get A if you attend and pay attention. No textbook but she does send notes online. Guest lecs too. She should speak louder. Overall interesting stories & useful for life. :),04/23/2014,3.0,3.0,,5,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,No,1398292598000,N/A,1484,N/A,,A-,[],people,people
