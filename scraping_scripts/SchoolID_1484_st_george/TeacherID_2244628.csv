The exams and coursework were challenging, but they were also very clear and fairly laid out/marked. I learned a lot and found that there was a really nice flow in her teachings. Dr. Hughes cares about students and their quality of education. Would take any of her courses again.",07/02/2019,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,3,No,1562030497000,Yes,1484,Yes,,A,"['Inspirational', 'Respected', 'Caring']",people,people
Mandatory,average,good,average,0,31612463,0,,average,3,PSY494,Some issues with the course this year but I think they will be corrected later. She's a difficult prof and currently lacks empathy for students. It feels like an intro course but it's marked like she hates you. It's difficult to improve in this course because the marking is very unclear. I recommend avoiding this prof if you're trying to do well.,04/17/2019,4.0,4.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,No,1555514619000,No,1484,Yes,,A-,"['Test heavy', 'Lecture heavy']",people,people

The last lecture was especially insightful and allowed me to see how much she really cares about critical topics within psychology and how much she is out there to help her students. The TA was pretty bad so the professor did extra work to help the students receive feedback.
