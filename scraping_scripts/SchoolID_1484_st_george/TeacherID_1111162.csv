He is so interesting to listen to both play and speak. And of course, a great great pedagogue.

N/A,poor,poor,poor,0,15948153,6,,awful,1,PIANO184,"Extremely philosophical, not very helpful.  Will talk for most of the lesson if he feels like it.  In studying rep, does not correct the student, but rather suggests different ways to play, so there is no definition of what is expected.  Hard to work with, too abstract and uses too many images instead of tangible guidance.",06/10/2009,1.0,1.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1244593745000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

You forget the idea of making mistakes and learn to play lyrically and intelligently.  He's a wonderful performer too, very experienced.  I transfered to UofT to study with him because lessons were so helpful!  You really feel valued and respected as his student, and this is not very common.",08/18/2008,3.0,3.0,,5,It's my life,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1219076630000,N/A,1484,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
