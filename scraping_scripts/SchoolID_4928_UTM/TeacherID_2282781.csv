Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,32349507,0,,awesome,5,MAT102,Very kind professor. Her logic of giving the lectures is clear. Also she always prepare biscuits for the students who take the class at night. She answer our questions with patience. Only problem is her pronunciation.

Mandatory,average,good,average,0,32276897,0,,poor,2,MAT135,Good person however not so good prof. Doesn't know how to explain anything asked in class so if you ask a question you will definitely be left confused. Has good examples however lack of clarity on her part makes it much harder to do well. Spends more time on easier and old concepts but spends less time on newer and harder concepts.,10/10/2019,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1570733160000,No,4928,Yes,,N/A,"['Lecture heavy', 'Tough grader', ""Skip class?
