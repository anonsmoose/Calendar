Mandatory,good,average,good,0,25469470,0,,good,4,HIS358,Great Prof. If you go to lectures and take good notes you will get good grades in his course. Very clear when describing what he wants from students. Drops hints throughout the semester on possible final exam questions. Very approachable when a student needs help. I would absolutely take another class with him. ,11/22/2015,2.0,2.0,,4,It's my life,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1448201297000,N/A,4928,Yes,,N/A,"[""Skip class?

Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22994826,0,,awesome,5,HIS261HIS358,Awesome Professor. Very helpful during office hours. I look forward to any class he teaches. His lectures are very clear and it is easy to understand what is important. Lectures are absolutely mandatory. He provides so much information to the course that is outside of the course readings. He is truly more than qualified. Highly recommend!,04/05/2014,2.0,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1396736923000,N/A,4928,N/A,,A-,[],people,people
