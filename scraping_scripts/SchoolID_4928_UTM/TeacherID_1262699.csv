His dry sense of humor, along with a willingness to be straight to the point keeps a fairly tough class light. Tests are a challenge, but he is lenient with marking. Be on time, do your work and brush up on matrix algebra if you are taking this class and wish to do well.",12/14/2012,5.0,5.0,,5,Really into it,4.0,4.0,1,No,1355446659000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,person

Course looked scary at the start, the assignments weren't easy, but they are really interesting and people in Commerce and Finance should definitely take the course. Attend classes, pay attention and actually put loads of effort into the assignments. You will enjoy the course if you stick with it and be glad you did it afterwards",09/05/2012,5.0,5.0,,5,It's my life,5.0,5.0,1,No,1346808212000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
