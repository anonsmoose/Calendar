Assignments were not properly explained and marks were docked for ridiculous things. She was never available for meetings outside class time and she was rude when you approached with a question.

N/A,good,average,good,0,15360160,0,,awesome,5,SOC349,"Prof. Friedmann is adorable, she really engages the class, and she knows her stuff, unlike most professors. My only beef with her is her TA, who was difficult (power trip). Also, didn't like the pop quiz component, TA's expectations were too high for 15 minutes, therefore getting perfect can be tricky, although not impossible. Overall great class.",01/12/2009,3.0,3.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,1231777131000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
