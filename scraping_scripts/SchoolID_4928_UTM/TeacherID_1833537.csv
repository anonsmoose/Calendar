This makes going to class pointless,but random attendance is taken. Group work is required through the whole term and is worth 45%. This is too much of your mark to be relying on other people to produce quality work.

She basically just reads out loud everything that's on her lecture slides. With that being said, her slides are quite informative.

Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,24500229,1,,average,3,GGR227,Good class. Lecture material is long but was most important for the test and exam. Straightforward in a sense that your knowledge of the lectures will show in your grade. Pretty fair and I would recommend this as a SCI credit for geography majors in the arts.,03/25/2015,3.0,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.0,3.0,1,No,1427287557000,N/A,4928,Yes,,B+,[],person,people

Overall the course itself is interesting. She is definitely more interesting than Conway.,08/20/2013,2.0,2.0,,4,Really into it,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1376999850000,N/A,4928,N/A,,A-,[],people,people
