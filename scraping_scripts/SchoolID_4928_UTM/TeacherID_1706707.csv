Mandatory,average,good,average,0,28103037,0,,poor,2,NEW315,"Pretty basic course. White Historian prof who thinks she is an expert at Caribbean history. Cannot speak to the racial politics that make up the Caribbean. She cannot link this to contemporary politics that surround food and the Caribbean economy in the present day. This course needs to be replaced with a Caribbean professor, preferably Afro.",04/22/2017,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1492876496000,No,4928,Yes,,B+,"['Participation matters', 'Get ready to read', 'Tough grader']",people,people
N/A,good,poor,good,0,20169915,0,,awesome,5,HIS203,"AWESOME professor. She really knows her stuff. When she marked the midterm, I got an 80. If she marked the exam, I probably would have gotten a higher mark, but the TA, what a horrible marker. The TA was an overall helpful person, but she's a tough marker and my grade dropped because of her marking.",05/01/2012,1.0,1.0,,5,It's my life,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1335910013000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
N/A,average,average,good,0,20105570,0,,good,3,HIS395,Food history is an interesting class to take. Prof. depends purely on reading articles since there is no textbook. Tests are based on readings. In general she is very generous in her marking and pretty much gives you the answer to things if you come to lecture. In general a great knowledgeable professor and would take her again.,04/23/2012,2.0,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1335222071000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
