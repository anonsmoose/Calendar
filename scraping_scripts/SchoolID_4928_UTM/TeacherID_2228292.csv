She also can answer any questions you have clearly. But her lectures are very dry, very very dry. Term test averages are quite low but covered some interesting topics.

Mandatory,good,average,good,0,27978852,5,,awesome,5,AST252,I learned a lot in this course. The lecture style really encouraged particiripation but wasn't pressuring. Quick quizzes of 10 questions worth a lot of the grade but manageable if you read the material and go over summary slides. Fair and accommodating incase of any reasonable issues.

Although she is good at explaining the concepts, her astronomy course is boring because she only talks about cold calculations and stays away from fun astronomy facts (the things that would make her course interesting). She only gives out small assignments and tests.

Take the science credit elsewhere. She sounds like your mom nagging you, and you see her THREE times a week, IN THE MORNING. Forget the textbook, just take notes.
