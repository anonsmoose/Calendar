Not Mandatory,average,good,average,0,22063341,0,,poor,2,341,She presents interesting lectures however she does not know how to evaluate students. Her tests m/c are based on memorizing a 500 page book in detail. For the test S/A there were many possible correct answers but only the ones that were on strict rubric were right.
