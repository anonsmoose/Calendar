However, I could take three psychology courses (known to have intense heavy readings) in place of one of her courses and have the exact same workload. plus text has too many statistics, but her lecs are interesting. I wish there were fewer readings.",11/03/2011,4.0,4.0,,4,Really into it,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1320289759000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

My only complaint is the heavy readings. I think it's too much for one course. But, she is such a kind and wonderful prof. She is very smart and I feel privileged to be taught by her.",09/17/2011,4.0,4.0,,5,It's my life,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1316302147000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
