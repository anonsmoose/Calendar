You could probably get away with skipping a good deal of class so long as you keep up with those. I found her pretty generous on marks for tests, but the labs can be hard because the marks are solely dependent on the accuracy and precision of your data",12/15/2016,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1481845449000,Yes,4928,Yes,,B,"['Lots of homework', 'Accessible outside class', 'Amazing lectures']",person,people

They focus on the concepts (no calculations at all), focus purely on lecture material and have choices of questions, so you don't have to study every single thing.

Problem sets once a month, & 2 midterms. 4 hr labs where your mark is solely on accuracy to accepted values (no subjectivity). The prof made my lab partner cry during a discussion, she  expects you to know all theory behind experiments, & barely gives any instructions/guidance.
