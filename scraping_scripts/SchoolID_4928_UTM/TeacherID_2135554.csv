Mandatory,good,good,good,3,27600889,0,,awesome,5,MGT428,MGT428 is not a traditional lecture style. He designed the course in a way that is really taught by the students for the students. Topics are not dry at all since students are presenting it (it would be very boring in a traditional lecture style). Weekly case hand ins require lots of work but does improve your case writing. Overall excellent prof.,12/22/2016,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1482379378000,Yes,4928,Yes,,A,"['Participation matters', 'Lots of homework', 'Respected']",people,people
Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,4,26777399,1,,good,4,MGT426,Lecture is very slow compared to PT's MGT322 (so it's boring). No case studies. 85-90% of the course is calculation based questions... 10-15% of the course is short answer questions... He tests the same questions every year for MGT426 (but somehow the class avg ends up being C+ even though he does not bellcurve up or down).
