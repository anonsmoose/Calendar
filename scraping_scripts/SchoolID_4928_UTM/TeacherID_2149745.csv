However, his practicals were pretty difficult if you don't put enough effort into it (like me). Overall, the prof was great!

My friend and I are not science students, but we did well in his class because he taught so well and made the material so interesting. I do not recommend skipping class since he hints at the exam and tests in lectures and gets most of the content from them.
