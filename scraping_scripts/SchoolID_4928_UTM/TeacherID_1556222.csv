Not a hard class but subjective teaching of pro-Russian view is very bothersome but I guess university knows no better; its like learning about Africa from British persective - you get some information you can believe, especially if you don't know better, but it doesn't give you actual info",06/04/2015,1.0,1.0,,1,Meh,1.0,1.0,1,No,1433411372000,N/A,4928,Yes,,N/A,[],people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,average,average,1,24009221,1,,average,1,HIST326,"Meh professor. His course narrative lacks depth and nuanced analysis. Get more out of a wiki article then his lectures. Good at telling funny anecdotes about Soviet leaders and what not, but not much in the way of actual content. Easy for those who enjoy a quick survey of a events.

Not only is he one of the best History profs in McGill, but when my laptop was stolen (with all my papers and notes on it) he was extremely kind, understanding, and most of all postponed my essay to be due at a suitable date.

N/A,good,average,good,1,23075679,1,,good,4,HIS250,He makes the lecture interesting. The TA can be a strict marker but comes to test and exams he will grade them fairly. It might appear as a hard class in beginning but  gives option between research paper and book report. Dnt worry you will be fine just take detailed notes in class. he does not post lecture slides with details just the pictures.,04/22/2014,2.0,2.0,,4,Low,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1398170631000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],person,person

The one set back is he's a bit stingy on the marking department, so put in some extra work!
