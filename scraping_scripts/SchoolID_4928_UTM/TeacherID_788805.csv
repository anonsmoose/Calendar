N/A,average,average,good,1,22735430,1,,good,3,BIO341BIO372,Prof. Anderson tests are not by any means easy. But if you like a challenge and want to put your brain to work these are the courses for you. I did do decent in his courses but I also did work hard. If you go to lectures and office hours you will actually do quite well. And yes he is actually very helpful if you go to office hours.,01/11/2014,3.0,3.0,,5,Really into it,4.0,4.0,1,No,1389441833000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],person,person
N/A,average,good,average,0,22674217,0,,average,3,BIO341,He touches on theory in lectures and hardly ever goes through a full example of practice problems. Yet he expects you to be able to apply theory to solve problems which you may have never seen before. Seems like a nice guy but is not helpful when you ask him questions and he seems to always be in a rush. Avoid this course if you can.,12/30/2013,5.0,5.0,,2,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,No,1388408952000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

N/A,average,good,average,0,11257810,2,,poor,2,BIO151,Good lecturer. Until you count what's on the tests. His lectures do not cover what's gonna be on tests entirely. Why make BIO supposed to be like CALculus & trick us with questions we weren't taught before is RIDICULOUS. (BIO is illogical. You either know it or don't. CAL is logical. You can deduce/apply from formulas). VERY UNFAIR TEST. Igot95%Cal,12/25/2005,5.0,5.0,,2,Really into it,2.0,2.0,1,N/A,1135517054000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
