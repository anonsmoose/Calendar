N/A,average,good,poor,0,18280778,0,,poor,2,PSY324,I heard good reviews about this course from my friends who took it with prof.Schimmack. But from the first class it was a big disappointment. Judith has a very monotone voice and she is not enthusiastic. The average for the midterm was a C(66%)which was much lower than a expected average in 3rd year courses (B-). She's not helpful.
