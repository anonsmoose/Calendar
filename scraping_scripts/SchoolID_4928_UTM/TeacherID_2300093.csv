N/A,average,average,average,0,31967416,0,,average,3,SOC205,She is a very good prof- the lectures can get boring ONLY because of the theories that she has to cover. This course is a prerequisite so you better take it with her. She also bumps up final marks and the final exam was easy! The papers were also VERY straightforward and simple but make sure you discuss your outline with the TAs.,05/29/2019,3.0,3.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1559090998000,Yes,4928,Yes,,A,"['Lots of homework', 'Clear grading criteria', 'Caring']",people,people
Not Mandatory,average,average,average,1,30765620,0,,average,3,SOC205,Teaches well! her slides are detailed. Concepts are not hard to understand. her Ta's mark fair. the tutorials are kind of a waste of time if you already know how to write a university paper but it still benefits you to go. the only downside is she assigns a lot of unnecessary readings (easily 100+ pages) per week. i never read most of them.,11/20/2018,2.0,2.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,No,1542750686000,Yes,4928,Yes,,N/A,"['Lots of homework', 'Lecture heavy']",people,person

She has so much important things to say and allows you to ask many questions even if she won't be able to finish the whole lecture in one day. I went to her office hours, and she gave me advice of how to study - which has helped me in the class. Really liked her!",04/13/2018,4.0,4.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1523624088000,Yes,4928,Yes,,B+,"['Lots of homework', 'Lecture heavy', 'Get ready to read']",people,people

Not Mandatory,average,good,average,4,28891048,1,,poor,2,SOC320,Boring lectures that are hard to sit through. Includes weekly assignments on readings that add up to a significant portion of final grade. Readings themselves are a chore to get through (100+ pages per week). No feedback for marked assignments. Genuinely the amount of effort required isn't worth the .5 credit.
