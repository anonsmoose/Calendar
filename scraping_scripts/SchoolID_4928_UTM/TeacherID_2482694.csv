Mandatory,good,average,good,0,32579714,0,,awesome,5,MGT363,Great prof. Writes his own tests and tells you exactly what you need to know. If you can take decent notes his tests are easy. But he does talk fast. Dont even bother trying to write your notes. Bring a laptop! First prof I have had that actually asks us for feedback. He literally changed the entire exam because we asked him to!,12/09/2019,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1575924925000,Yes,4928,Yes,,N/A,"[""Skip class?

Mandatory,average,good,average,0,32381022,0,,poor,2,MGT363,His tests emphasized too much on memorization - what's the point of it? No application of the theory at all. When I flipped the midterm over I just feel like he wants us to be a human dictionary. Upper level management courses shouldn't be like that. We're not first years anymore and the course should be well-structured and applicable.,11/08/2019,5.0,5.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1573185406000,No,4928,Yes,,N/A,"['Test heavy', 'Group projects', 'Participation matters']",people,people
