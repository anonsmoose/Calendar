Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,32955316,0,,awesome,5,PSY391,"Prof. Martin is passionate about what hes teaching, encourages class discussion, and is easy to get ahold of to clarify concepts. The course itself is not the easiest material as far as psych courses go but if you like neurosci its really interesting. This was hands down the best class I took at UTM so if you have a chance to take it, do it!",03/06/2020,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1583457479000,Yes,4928,Yes,,N/A,"['Amazing lectures', 'Accessible outside class', 'Respected']",people,people

Mandatory,good,good,good,0,30230122,2,,good,4,PSY391,This was a really good course loved the content but you have to work hard in order to get an A. The TAs for his course were extremely picky and hard markers but some of the questions on his tests were repeated from past tests. Most of the final exam was also repeated. I recommend taking good notes and studying them alongside his slides.,06/04/2018,4.0,4.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,No,1528134134000,Yes,4928,Yes,,A+,"[""Skip class?
