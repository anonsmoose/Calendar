You can do well in this class if you have no problem massaging his ego and telling him he is right rather than asking critical questions and seeing other viewpoints. On top of that his behavior is extremely unprofessional",01/16/2018,4.0,4.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1516144693000,No,4928,Yes,,N/A,[],people,people

The lectures put you to sleep, HE CONSTANTLY SHOWS UP late to class and does not care about the students. As well he believes he knows more than any political theorist, as he has denounced authors such as Machiavelli, Hobbes and Rousseau countless times.",02/17/2017,2.0,2.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1487347695000,No,4928,Yes,,A,['Graded by few things'],people,people

His descriptions while interesting also take him a while to say. His essays are fair however, and if you do your work you will do fine. I enjoyed the course material despite his monotone.
