Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,31199404,9,,awesome,5,STA256,Jerry is one of the best Stats profs here at UTM along with Al. He is lovely during office hours. I agree any course gets harder with Jerry but its worth it. His teaching style is extremely fluid and clear. A bit test heavy for STA256 but not for his upper year courses.,01/04/2019,1.0,1.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,3,Yes,1546597335000,Yes,4928,Yes,,A+,"['Inspirational', ""Skip class?

N/A,average,good,average,6,31181752,0,,poor,2,STA256,"Jerry's a nice guy if you talk to him, but he is not a great lecturer. He reads off the powerpoints word by word, with not much detail. Difficult to understand because he skips over concepts and expects you to know them. He does not show all of his mathematical and proof work, so it is hard to understand solutions. Super test heavy and no curve.",01/01/2019,5.0,5.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1546302883000,No,4928,Yes,,N/A,"['Tough grader', 'Graded by few things', 'Test heavy']",people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,6,31051831,0,,awful,1,STA256,"His lecture is completely useless, all he does is go through the slides. His coordination of the course was really bad, firstly the marking style is &quot;all or nothing&quot; you either get a 100 or 0 (even if there is a little mistake). Secondly, there is no curves, Test 3 was super hard. Remarking was a major issue, allowed less than a week for remark.",12/16/2018,5.0,5.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1544973318000,No,4928,Yes,,N/A,"['Test heavy', 'Lots of homework', 'Graded by few things']",people,people
