N/A,poor,good,poor,0,10859547,0,,poor,1,HIS201,The amount of material and the difficulty of the material covered does not corrospond with the level of the class (this is supposed to be a second year class and fourth year students are having difficulty). Testing questions are often unclear and the marking is therefore sparadic (there has to be a problem when that many students agree).,11/09/2005,5.0,5.0,,2,It's my life,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,1131517414000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
