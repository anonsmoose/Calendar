However, much of the information she presents is hard to grasp since there is so much of it and no lectures are posted online (need to attend lectures).

Professor Bejan began the first class by telling us that she likes to make her students work hard and that it was going to be a hard year. Then she wrote a bunch of Latin on the board.
