N/A,poor,good,poor,0,25447392,0,,awful,1,MAT134,i dropped his class real quick. the first day i went into the lecture i couldn't understand what he was saying. he seems like he's always in a rush and doesn't explain concept very well,11/18/2015,5.0,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1447886965000,N/A,4928,Yes,,N/A,['Lecture heavy'],people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,2,25405677,0,,awful,1,MAT135,Worst prof by far at UTM. He doesn't explain concepts well and his English is poor. Often during lectures he messes himself up and wastes time trying to explain WHY he did what he did rather than explain how the question is actually done. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!,11/12/2015,5.0,5.0,,1,Meh,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1447370682000,N/A,4928,Yes,,N/A,['Lecture heavy'],people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,3,23443372,0,,awful,1,MAT135,It seems he doesn't understand math. During his examples he often can't even make simple additions. Don't try to follow his train of thought during class he will go all over the place and end up drawing examples in random locations on the board.,07/14/2014,5.0,5.0,,1,Really into it,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1405325048000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,2,22957522,1,,awful,1,MAT135,He is very confusing and gets his own examples wrong. He writes all over the board and usually rushes through the examples. His writing is tiny and illegible from the 2nd row. He will not spend more than 10 min per lecture on content. The rest on examples that he will rush through. I found the textbook more useful than attending class.,03/27/2014,5.0,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1395946737000,N/A,4928,N/A,,N/A,[],person,people
