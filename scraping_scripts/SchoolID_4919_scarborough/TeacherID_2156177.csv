Mandatory,good,good,good,2,29267407,1,,awesome,5,SOC367,I won't get an A but I don't resent the Prof for it. I learned so much. So much! Her humor showed her humility and she talked about her mistakes and her own racism. That made me feel like it's okay. I am learning. I loved all the readings even if they didn't make sense until her lectures. I am a white man who is grateful for a hilarious WOC prof!!!,12/18/2017,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1513636259000,Yes,4919,Yes,,B,"['Amazing lectures', 'Caring']",person,people
Mandatory,good,average,good,0,29027064,0,,awesome,5,SOC367,Shaista is an amazing lecturer. This was one of my favourite courses I've ever taken. She really cares about her students and wants to see them succeed. She doesn't test based on what she hasn't covered in class and she's awkward but it's quirky. She's very intelligent and passionate about what she teaches.,12/03/2017,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1512334638000,Yes,4919,Yes,,A,"['Caring', 'Hilarious']",people,people
Mandatory,good,good,good,0,28544457,0,,awesome,5,SOC335,She makes you work hard. But she explains all the difficult readings really well in her lectures. Don't ever miss her lecture or you won't do well on anything in her course. She's funny though. I want to take more courses with her for sure.  TA was a hard grader though but the Prof sometimes changed the grade to a better one.,07/20/2017,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1500517359000,Yes,4919,Yes,,A,"['Inspirational', 'Lecture heavy', 'Amazing lectures']",people,people
