The course is entirely dependent on the huge textbook, and you have to pretty much know every thing in it to do well on the exam. TAs are unnecessarily tough graders and are hard to please.

Mandatory,good,average,good,0,31130059,0,,awesome,5,WSTA01,Extremely sweet professor! The course consists of a few papers worth 15-20% each and a final exam in which she gives a list of what to study. Was my easiest course of 1st semester because you're dealing with concepts that are talked about in tutorials instead of memorization. Sometimes cool guests would be brought in too! recommend.,12/21/2018,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1545414788000,Yes,4919,Yes,,A,"['Caring', 'Inspirational', ""Skip class?
