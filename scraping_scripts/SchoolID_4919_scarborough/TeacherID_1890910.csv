Mandatory,good,average,good,0,27270182,3,,awesome,5,FREA98,Mme Rovers* (typo in the name inputted on this site) was a wonderful Professor. I took FREA96-99 with her and she made her classes very interactive with the students and ensured everyone was actually learning by going at a slower pace as she noticed several students struggled with french. Would definitely recommend taking her as a prof.,11/29/2016,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1480382144000,Yes,4919,Yes,,A+,"['Participation matters', 'Caring', 'Group projects']",people,people

Instructions are vague and confusing and when she tries to clarify, she makes it more confusing.
