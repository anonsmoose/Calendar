Just reach out if you're not clear with the assignments, and she'll actually provide you with useful comments. Those 2 lab assignments are pretty fair. First assignment might be a bit tricky but the second one is absolutely easy. No presentations needed ! p.s. syllabus differs depending on which prof is teaching",05/10/2018,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1525965119000,Yes,4919,Yes,,A,"['Participation matters', 'Respected', 'Gives good feedback']",people,people

This lab had only two assignments which either make or break your grade but she gives good feedback for each and very clearly outlines requirements. Only issue I had was with her TA having a quality standard for the second assignment & costing me a grade by 1%. Deal directly with prof if possible!",06/13/2017,3.0,3.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,No,1497397497000,Yes,4919,Yes,,B+,"['Gives good feedback', 'Graded by few things', ""Skip class?
