Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,26087704,1,,awful,1,HS3400,Worst prof I have ever had. Gives very ambiguous directions with NO marking schemes for assignments and insultingly easy exams (waste of time studying). Did not mark assignments until after the super easy final exam so she could just assign marks to them and even out the class average. Lectures contained half the content from the last week.

Very repetitive... you will read the same ppt slide 37 times!! Only tests lecture material so doing all the readings is pointless. Exams are easy, literally word for word definitions from lecture slides. ",10/23/2015,3.0,3.0,,3,Meh,3.0,3.0,1,No,1445598440000,N/A,4919,Yes,,N/A,[],people,people
