N/A,average,good,average,0,12760796,0,,poor,2,ANTA02,I found his lectures interesting. But he was obviously an inexperienced prof. He didn't give TAs guideline for marking the assignment so TAs differed in how they marked. He was rude to some students in the online discussion forum&refused to reveal our participation marks even when he promised to do so.
