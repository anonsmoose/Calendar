His lectures were really fast and covered a lot of content, but it was all interesting concepts and modern technologies. His assignments and exercises built on top of each other and he was fairly generous with grading. His finals are incredibly fair, and there's a high chance at a good mark",04/18/2019,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1555552511000,Yes,4919,Yes,,A+,"['Caring', 'Amazing lectures', 'Group projects']",people,people

He doesn't show you that he cares when you talk to him but he does give it thought. His assignments and labs are clear, they are bite sized and have a clear learning objective.
