Extremely caring and always helpful, doesn't mind spending time to make sure everyone understands the content. Assignments extremely easy but test the content well, exams are very fair. If you haven't taken a course with Stefanos, you're really really missing out. Enroll right now!!!",01/21/2020,1.0,1.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1579580153000,Yes,4919,Yes,,A+,"['Accessible outside class', 'EXTRA CREDIT', 'Caring']",people,people
N/A,good,average,good,0,31627682,0,,good,4,MATC44,Stefanos is a great prof! There is no textbook but that doesn't matter because his lecture notes are good and he posts them as well. I recommend going to lecture because he elaborates on his notes. The final and midterm were easy just studying off of the lecture notes is enough. I would definitely take other courses with him!,04/19/2019,2.0,2.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,No,1555640380000,Yes,4919,Yes,,N/A,[],people,people
