N/A,good,average,good,0,15184694,0,,awesome,5,BGYB51H3,I think this was his first year teaching Evolutionary and it showed in the best ways. He was always enthusiastic and  really well prepared for his lectures. He's very clear and likes to keep lectures light by making jokes. His midterm was very easy but his final was much harder. Overall I enjoyed his class a lot.,12/13/2008,2.0,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1229185266000,N/A,4919,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
