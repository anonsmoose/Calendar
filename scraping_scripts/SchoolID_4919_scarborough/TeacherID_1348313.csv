She tended to read off her slides but when it comes to exam, you have to know everything accurately (all lecture slides). She tends to focus on MC, short answer and one long answer. If you know your material throughly, you should be fine. Overall, was an interesting course.",11/22/2012,2.0,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,1353619689000,N/A,4919,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
