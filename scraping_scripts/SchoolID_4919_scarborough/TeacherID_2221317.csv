Show up to class, come to office hours and she will take the time to get to know you. Class definitely isnt a bird, if you hate math, there is some basic math.

Mandatory,good,average,good,3,27650268,7,,awesome,5,PHYD37,DV is one of the strongest lecturers at UTSC. She makes a strong effort to listen to students; it's easy to talk to her. Her informative lectures move at a great pace. She didn't follow a particular textbook; you need to attend lectures and take careful notes to succeed. The assignments/evaluations are consistent with lecture notes. Great Teacher!,12/31/2016,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1483208253000,Yes,4919,Yes,,A-,"['Caring', ""Skip class?
