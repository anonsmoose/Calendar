He likes to give bonus maybe because we did really not good in term tests. The questions are too many in one midterm test and only less than one hour for it. Also, writing a term paper is so difficult and still need to give the presentation.

Mandatory,average,good,average,0,32269764,0,,poor,2,MATB44,We were the first class he taught after his PHD so I don't blame him too much but his teaching style is really fast (he really needs to slow it down and explain each concept and give examples).... no one really gets what's going on in the course.
