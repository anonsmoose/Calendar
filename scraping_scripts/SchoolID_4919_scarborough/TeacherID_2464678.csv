He's really great at sharing personal experiences, but the rest of the content is very dry. A lot of people chose to skip class because they could just memorize the textbook or the slides. The MC exams are also on the excessively tedious side, but his short answers are extremely fair.",12/19/2019,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1576729718000,Yes,4919,Yes,,N/A,"['Lots of homework', 'Respected', 'Gives good feedback']",people,people

Two group projects, two fifteen page papers, one of which is with the group but still. Four &quot;reflection&quot; papers. One of the papers he made us read was of course a paper he co authored that was like 30 pages long.",02/21/2019,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1550791295000,No,4919,Yes,,N/A,"['Tough grader', 'Group projects', 'Lots of homework']",person,people
