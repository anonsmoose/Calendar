Very clear on subject, Lecture notes are well organized but mostly reworded from the text. Assignments are very difficult, get help with them. Overall good prof good class.",04/28/2006,4.0,4.0,,4,It's my life,4.5,4.5,1,N/A,1146251323000,N/A,4919,N/A,,N/A,[],people,person
N/A,good,average,average,0,11482174,0,,good,4,ASTA02,So far he is a very peculiar prof. His lectures are beyond boring cuz he reads from the lecture notes which are basically paragraphs and not like Allen Attard's slides which were in point form!! He seems like a very nice guy but so far his lectures made me get up and leave on several occasions,02/14/2006,3.0,3.0,,3,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,N/A,1139876157000,N/A,4919,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
