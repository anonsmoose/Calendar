Mandatory,good,average,good,0,31521790,0,,awesome,5,BIOC63,I have taken 4 courses with Dr. Sturge and she is one of the best profs I have had. She made my university experience so much more interesting. I get what people say about her reading of slides but she always mentions that it helps students retain the material better. Her exams are extremely far and she is alwyas so kind and helpful.
