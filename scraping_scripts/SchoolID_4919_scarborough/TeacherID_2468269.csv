The whole course was just him having a conversation of his own with the guest. The instructions for assignments were highly unclear and he was very unhelpful. When asked a question he was confused as to the content of his own course.",04/26/2019,4.0,4.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1556241897000,No,4919,Yes,,N/A,"['Group projects', 'Graded by few things', 'Tough grader']",people,people
Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,31681824,0,,awful,1,CITC12,lol this class was a COMPLETE joke. Learned absolutely nothing and put way too much work in it for a prof that didnt give a crap. When we asked questions his response was ugh just do a good job I cant believe I wasted my time taking this class and putting so much effort in assignments only to loose marks on requirements pulled out of thin air.,04/26/2019,5.0,5.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1556240427000,No,4919,No,,N/A,[],people,people
Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,31681775,0,,awful,1,CITC12,"did not follow any assignment requirements that were outlined in the syllabus. graded on elements that werent even asked for. Completely ridiculous and misleading marking scheme. Didnt lecture at all, talked about facts that he clearly googled for 10 minutes and made a guest lecture speak instead and interrupted them often. Should teach at york",04/26/2019,4.0,4.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1556240149000,No,4919,Yes,,N/A,['Tough grader'],people,people
