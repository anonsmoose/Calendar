Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,32460322,0,,awful,1,WSTB12H3,Absolutely horrible. She can't teach at all. Never posts lecture slides up. Is very rude and doesn't offer help. Doesn't explain any assignments. She always has discussions in class to ask others for their opinion rather than teach us anything relevant. Makes you do weekly responses which she never marks so you don't know how you're doing.,11/22/2019,3.0,3.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1574384459000,No,4919,Yes,,Not sure yet,['Participation matters'],people,people
