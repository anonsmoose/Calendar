Mandatory,good,average,good,0,29527180,0,,awesome,5,PSYD54,I took the B03 course with Dr. Nestor a few years ago. That course was terrible (and there were reasons outside the prof's teaching for the difficulties). PSYD54 was much better. The Prof did a great job organizing the course. He's also very respectful and listens to your thoughts. I'd recommend taking PSYD54 with Adrian as it's a fair course.,02/01/2018,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1517491537000,Yes,4919,Yes,,A+,"['Respected', 'Accessible outside class', 'Participation matters']",people,people
