His lecturing style is very engaging, and although you have to write 5 papers (worth 20% each) for his class, there are no exams and no huge ""final paper"". His course really prepares you for graduate school (if you're interested in that).",02/01/2015,3.0,3.0,,3,Really into it,4.0,4.0,1,No,1422833989000,N/A,4919,N/A,,N/A,"['Tough grader', ""Skip class?
