Mandatory,average,good,average,1,29585198,0,,poor,2,VIC281,The pop culture course was weird. It was 12 weeks of analyzing dense academic articles. Prof. McLeod basically put all of the work on the students to &quot;present&quot; and he would periodically jump in and talk for five minutes. It's gotta be the laziest form of &quot;teaching&quot; I've ever seen. I got a good grade but I nearly lost my mind - it was that boring.,02/21/2018,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1519239061000,No,4919,Yes,,A,"['So many papers', 'Gives good feedback', ""Skip class?

He is a genius but makes it a point to teach you how to listen to and analyze music. My friends and I look for courses taught by him (very rare). He uses videos, jokes and examples from movies and tv to help us learn better.",03/08/2013,3.0,3.0,,3,Really into it,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1362707855000,N/A,4919,N/A,,N/A,[],person,people
