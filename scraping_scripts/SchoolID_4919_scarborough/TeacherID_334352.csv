But your marks will also rely on working in groups so be a team player. Really cool guy and willing to set up a time outside of class to help with anything you're struggling with.

But he is always extremely helpful and rewards attendance/hard work with good marks.  Don't expect to coast through this class.  Only thing is sometimes I feel he tries a little to hard to be 'cool'.  Tells great stories!,03/13/2011,2.0,2.0,,5,Really into it,5.0,5.0,1,No,1300024615000,N/A,4919,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
