I got an A- (my first in uni!!!) but only because she's really clear on what to expect on tests and assignments. Fair marker which is a plus! Gotta admit, bit of a crush on her. Wish she taught more courses. Definitely recommend!",05/10/2013,2.0,2.0,,5,Sorta interested,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1368188103000,N/A,4919,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
