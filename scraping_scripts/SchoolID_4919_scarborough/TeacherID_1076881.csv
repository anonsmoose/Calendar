Mandatory,good,average,good,5,28121975,1,,awesome,5,MGAC50,"Very good professor. Yes folks, tax is a hard course because of all the reading and necessity to understand the material. He pushes you to work hard but you can do well if you do the questions he assigns and keep up with the material. The chapters are long and take time to read and understand. If you decide to read in the last minute, you'll fail",04/25/2017,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1493134803000,Yes,4919,Yes,,A,"['Get ready to read', ""Skip class?

He will push you no doubt, but he pushes you so that you do better. Exams are tough but if you keep up with readings and DO ALL assigned questions, you can get 80+. Overall, a great prof and a great guy. I wish he taught more courses!",11/08/2015,3.0,3.0,,4,It's my life,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1446953966000,Yes,4919,Yes,,A+,"['Inspirational', ""Skip class?
