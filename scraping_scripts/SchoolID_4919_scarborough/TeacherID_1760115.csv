It was her first time teaching the course and it's a very very hard course to teach. The school should hire a histologist, ideally, but with her background and all, she did the best she could.

Made mistakes all the time during lecture. You will do well if you're good at memorizing, but half the stuff we learned was probably wrong. Don't read the textbook as she contradicts it often, you'll just get confused. Very rude prof!",01/03/2013,4.0,4.0,,2,Really into it,2.0,2.0,1,No,1357221057000,N/A,4919,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

She makes grotesque mistakes during lectures, has an abysmal teaching style, and watching her lectures makes me tear up in pain. She refuses to acknowledge mistakes in marking and will not correct grades. Our TA was amazing however. I love histology, but I would not recommend taking if she is your professor.",12/10/2012,4.0,4.0,,1,Meh,1.0,1.0,1,No,1355160125000,N/A,4919,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
