Every lecture is fun and informative, and she is always so energetic and caring. Extremely helpful outside of class too, more than any other prof I've had. Not the easiest prof, but she appreciates when you put effort into things. I highly recommend taking her class.",04/04/2018,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1522834423000,Yes,4919,Yes,,N/A,"['Accessible outside class', 'Inspirational', 'Amazing lectures']",people,people
