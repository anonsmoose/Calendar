She's also super sweet and approachable, answers questions quickly, and is happy to give feedback. There is a group seminar but it's pretty easy. Would take a class with her again!!",08/01/2018,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1533123001000,Yes,4919,Yes,,N/A,"['Participation matters', 'Get ready to read', 'Amazing lectures']",people,people

She had 33 readings for the course, it was cumulative &amp; she's really picky with marking. The presentations should have been easy marks. She doesn't give group evals which makes it hard to get the mark that you actually deserve. She's really unclear with her instructions.
