N/A,average,average,poor,0,18815579,0,,poor,2,PHLB05,"D.Bader is basically one of the worst ones I have ever had in 3 years at UTSC. He ALWAYS read off of slides. NEVER allowed class discussions. Assignments were small but did not competently test students' knowledge. He doesn't organize his lecture materials and never responds to emails on time. Sorry for the rant, but don?t take his class (IMO).",07/13/2011,3.0,3.0,,1,Low,1.5,1.5,1,No,1310569759000,N/A,4919,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
