Assignment expectations are pretty vague. BUT Kelly is very laid back and if you do the readings you will do well in the course. His lectures don't cover much of the readings so make sure you read, the exams are 100% based on reading materials.",05/03/2018,3.0,3.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,No,1525355974000,No,4919,Yes,,N/A,['Group projects'],person,people

He wasn't very accessible - he didn't have office hours and it was hard getting him to respond to emails. But, he's a pretty generous marker.
