Materials can be hard, but if you do all assignment and worksheet you will be fine on exams. She is inspirational on math, and it requires thinking for assignments. You will learn a lot with her if you do put time on the course.",12/15/2019,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1576384233000,Yes,4919,Yes,,Not sure yet,"['Respected', 'Caring', 'Gives good feedback']",people,people

She treats mathematics very deeply and expects you to understand it deeply as well. If you want an easy pass, she is not the right prof but if you actually want to learn and willing to put the work (she askes for a lot) she is the one!",11/20/2019,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1574284241000,Yes,4919,Yes,,N/A,"['Accessible outside class', 'Participation matters', 'Lots of homework']",people,people

If you put in the work you will do good. Exams are tough but to solve this try studying past exams (they are very similar!)

In lecture, she makes lots of mistakes and her writing is not the clearest either. She also goes quick in lecture, she will go over proof of theorems and examples in 3-5 minutes. She teaches more theory and does not provide many examples.",08/21/2019,4.0,4.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1566410234000,Yes,4919,Yes,,A+,"['Caring', 'Lots of homework', 'Lecture heavy']",people,people

Sometimes she rushes through stuff but slows down and explains things if you ask her, and does good review. Camelia is open to questions and corrections and is really smart but doesn't have too much of ego unlike some other professors.
