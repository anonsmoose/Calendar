N/A,good,average,good,0,19715046,0,,awesome,5,ECMB,AWESOME PROF!!! He explains everything VERY clearly and makes sure we understand everything before he moves on. He is funny at times! His exams and quiz is very fair and easy if you study.. I suggest keep doing the problems he assigns.. he has a tendency to use questions from the past versions of textbook.. not the current ones.,01/12/2012,2.0,2.0,,5,It's my life,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1326330606000,N/A,4919,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
