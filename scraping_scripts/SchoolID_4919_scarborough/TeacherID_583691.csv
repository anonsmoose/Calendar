Super lazy professor, she does not proof read notes, copies from textbook, skips classes on Fridays for no reason (literally no reason).

She makes sure not to disclose information in class so you have to listen to never ending useless stories and parse through for useful information.

Her style of marking resembles that on an English prof. (not the best one; basically if she agrees with you you'll get a good mark).
