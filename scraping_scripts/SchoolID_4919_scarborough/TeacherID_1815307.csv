Detailed textbook notes and lecture notes (keep writing for the whole class- the slides are key points only and won't tell you much) will pretty much guarantee your mark.

N/A,poor,good,poor,0,23771358,2,,awful,1,PSYB20,Lectures are easy but tests are brutal. Some of the questions are worded vaguely which can confuse a student. The easy lectures give an illusion that the tests will be easy too but this is not the case. Tests are not fair. Lecture content could be finished in 1 hour but the prof drags it till 2 and a half hours.
