Her verbatim recital of the lecture slides made her class boring and unbearable.

Her monotoned voice coupled with the fact that her lecture slides were literally copy pasta from the textbook made lectures difficult and lacklustre to sit through. Exams required that you memorized every piece of info religiously. Nice prof, but boring class.",12/24/2018,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1545692729000,No,4919,Yes,,N/A,"[""Skip class?
