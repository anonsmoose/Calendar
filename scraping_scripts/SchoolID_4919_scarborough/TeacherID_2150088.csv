Mandatory,poor,average,poor,2,30141385,1,,awful,1,GGRA30H3,He is a nice guy but an awful teacher. I know he works in GIS but he really shouldnt be teaching it. His voice is super monotone and his slides are really hard to follow. Also im finding it hard to understand where my marks are coming from and i feel like this prof is really disorganized. Im already finding GIS hard too so this doesnt help,05/17/2018,3.0,3.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1526594099000,No,4919,Yes,,N/A,['Participation matters'],person,people
Mandatory,average,average,average,1,26908346,0,,average,3,GGRA30,He's really kind and approachable if you have any questions/need help!! I found his lectures to be little dry and monotone tbh and had to fight to stay awake (although it was an evening lecture). Don't skip lectures - there's in class quizzes. The content isn't difficult as long as you can grasp the tutorials/assignments using the software quickly.,08/18/2016,3.0,3.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,No,1471555394000,No,4919,Yes,,N/A,"['Clear grading criteria', 'Lecture heavy', 'Participation matters']",people,person
