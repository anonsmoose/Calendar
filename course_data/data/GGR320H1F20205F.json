Specifically, the course addresses the transnationalization and feminization of migrant populations and various segments of the global labor force. The coursework focuses on analyzing classical paradigms in migration studies, as well as emerging theoretical approaches to gender and migration. In addition, it traces the shifting empirical trends in gendered employment and mobility patterns. It uses in-depth case study material to query the frameworks employed in migration studies and to understand the grounded implications of gendered migration. It pays particular attention to the interventions made by feminist geographers in debates about work, migration, place, and space.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Geography and Planning", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Summer F", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": []}
