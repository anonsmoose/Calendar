{"id": "ENG327H5Y20205", "code": "ENG327H5Y", "name": "Blame Chaucer", "description": "This course takes a close look at some of the bawdy, irreverent, and even dangerous texts written in fourteenth-century England by Geoffrey Chaucer. As he recounts erotic dreams, tells the story of a faithless woman in\u00ffTroilus and Criseyde, and narrates tales told on a riotous, drunken pilgrimage in\u00ffThe Canterbury Tales, Chaucer repeatedly tells his readers not to blame him for what he writes. Students in this course will ask: who is to blame, if not the author himself?
