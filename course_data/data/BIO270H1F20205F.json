This course uses examples from throughout the animal kingdom, in a comparative approach, to introduce and study homeostasis and the endocrine system. Accompanying laboratories reinforce concepts introduced in lectures and provide opportunities for students to experience firsthand the role that experimentation, data collection, interpretation of data, and communication of data plays in the nature of the scientific process. (Lab Materials Fee: $10). Lab coat and safety glasses are required for use in laboratories; students are responsible for purchasing these items (approximate cost is $25).", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Cell and Systems Biology", "prerequisites": "BIO130H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Summer F", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "MP 134"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "MP 134"}], "size": 72, "enrolment": 34}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "RW 209"}], "size": 48, "enrolment": 27}, {"code": "P0201", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "RW 209"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 5}]}
