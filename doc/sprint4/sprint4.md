Participants: Amit Ohm, Peter Tamraz
Spoke with Professor Dema about the number of group members who have dropped the course and decided that we will reduce the number of user stories that we will complete. 
For this Sprint we just want to complete a website where users can search for current UofT courses and add them to a calender.
Decided that Amit would complete the code that would allow us to search for courses through our database, and petter would allow the user to add that course to the calender once a course has been selected.
