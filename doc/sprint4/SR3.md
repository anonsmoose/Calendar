Minimal work was done for this sprint due to the fact that so many of our members dropped the course. Looking back, we probably
should have made contingency plans for this, and hda a process setup for if this did happen. It was a little overwhelming for us to
complete the project given we lost so many members.

One thing that we could improve on is seperation of responsibilities. Because we have a lack of human resources, we should make sure we are
being as effecient as possible. We should not be working on the same thing, this is critical in a situation where you lose resources, you 
should be as effecient as possible with that resource.
