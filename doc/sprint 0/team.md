###  Communication response times
>Methods of communication used such as phone, email, and discord should be checked at least once a day to make sure issues get resolved quickly.

### Standup/other agile meetings
> At least have one face-to-face meeting every week and one meeting online in order to make sure we don't fall behind. 
We will plan more meetings if need be.

### Meeting preparation
>Every member should have a short summary of what they have done, what they are working on and any issues they might have had.

### Version control
> Make commit messages as meaningful and semantic as possible.
Make the changes in each commit atomic.
Commit new features to new branches.

### Roles and division of work
>We will agree on our first User Stories as a group, after that any member can take a free User Story after they have done their own.

### Submitting sprint deliverables and software
>Parham Fartoot will be in charge of submitting before deadlines and Amit Ohm will be in charge of reviewing the submissions.
In case Parham Fartoot is not available or able to submit on time, he will let the rest of the group know in advance.

### Contingency planning
>In the case of a member dropping the course, the group will take on their User Stories and divide the added workload.
We should all agree on an estimate of how long a given User Story should take as we define them, and we will keep a record of completed User Stories and the one currently being worked on so that we can know who has done what, this will give us a clear current status of the project so that we can make adjustments if it seems that we are not on track to meet deadlines.
