In this document we will state our main competitors for our product.


1.) **University of Toronto provided tools:** Our largest competitor will be the tools that the University of Toronto provides itself. Namely, the timetable websites for each campus located at: [https://student.utm.utoronto.ca/timetable/](https://student.utm.utoronto.ca/timetable/)
[https://timetable.iit.artsci.utoronto.ca/](https://timetable.iit.artsci.utoronto.ca/)
[https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/regoffice/timetable/timetable.php](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/regoffice/timetable/timetable.php)

All 3 planners allow the user to view information about every lecture and tutorial section for every course. However, only the UTM and UTSG timetable planners allow the user to create their own plan by selecting courses and adding to a "current plan". 

This is our largest competitor because this is the tool that the vast majority of users will use. We believe our product will be an attractive option to these users because of some of our additional features, eg: allowing UTSC students to view a "current plan", allowing users to make a plan with courses from separate campuses, and automatically generating a plan for the user. Therefore, capturing the users of this competitor will involve informing them about an alternative option. 

2.) **griddy**: This is our direct competition because it is also a third-party University of Toronto course planner. It's website can be found here: https://griddy.org

This product allows the user to add UTM courses to a timetable. This product does not add any additional functionality compared to the university provided UTM timetable. However, the user interface is better as the user is able to search for and add courses and view their current plan at the same time. Our product is still a more attractive option due to the additional features described above.



**In conclusion**, Although competition for our product does exist, our added features still leaves space for us in the market.
