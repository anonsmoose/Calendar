Team organization:

We organized the team by assigning clearly defined roles and tasks to each member of the group. Furthermore, we used tools such as Discord to hold group conference calls, to share documents and to have access to a group chat, in order to insure that everyone is on the same page before going forward.

Decision making:

When it came to decision making we held frequent rounds of brainstorming, sharing our ideas and discussing them with each other. When we believed we had sufficiently discussed the matters, we used an online polling system to vote and choose the best possible option. For example, in the case of choosing the project, at first, we discussed possible ideas and created a document containing said ideas and a short description of them. When we believed we had reached a sufficient number, we discussed them further and held our first round of voting. In the end we chose the five most popular options and held another round of voting to finalize our decision.

Prioritizing user stories:

During our in-person meeting, we discussed the goals and criteria of success for our project and after that, we started to come up with different User Stories discussing how they would fit into our goals and if the majority of the group saw it as appropriate we would add it to our list. After we had all our User Stories we discussed how important each of them was and how much time and effort it would take to implement each. When the group had reached a conclusion we would use that to prioritize each User Story.

Meetings:

We had agreed on every member checking the discord channel daily to ensure all problems would be resolved as soon as possible, furthermore, we held one conference call on discord to discuss our ideas for this project and we held and in-person meeting to discuss User Stories, prioritize them and assign roles and tasks to each member of the group.

Next phase:

Going forward we agree that we should try to ensure good and effective communication between all members of the groups and have a clear division of roles and tasks. We should also plan for our calls and meeting more ahead in time and have all the details regarding these meetings such as the room figured out as soon as possible.
