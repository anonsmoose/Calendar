Project Objective:

Our objective is to create a course scheduling web application for students at UTM. This application will automatically generate an optimal timetable for students while considering many factors, such as the students’ preference on lecture timings, degree and program requirements, and number of courses they want to take per semester.

Key Users:

John – John is a full-time student at UTM and is about to enter the 3rd year of his computer science specialist.
Jane – Jane recently graduated highschool and is going to start school at UTM. She wishes to graduate with a double major in biology and chemistry.

Scenarios:
 
John would like to create a schedule for the third year of his computer science specialist. John wishes to stay on track to graduate by the end of his fourth year. He still requires 1.0 credits in Humanities, but has completed all other breadth requirements
 
Jane would like a timetable for her first year at UTM and is unsure of what courses she should take. She wishes to finish her Humanities breadth requirement and satisfy all the requirements to enroll in her Biology and Chemistry POSts by the end of first year. She also prefers to take classes in the morning, and would like to have little to no classes on Friday.

Principles:

Our key principles are student satisfaction and graduation efficiency. Our program will create the most optimal non-conflicting timetable for UTM students to be able to graduate as soon as possible while also maximizing student satisfaction through prioritizing their choices on lecture timings, number of credits, and several other factors.
